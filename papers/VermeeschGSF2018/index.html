<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >Geology is, in essence, a historical science in which timing is of the utmost importance. Geochronology underpins
the study of Earth history and puts fundamental constraints on the rate of biological evolution (<a 
href="#Xchen2012">Chen and
Benton</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xchen2012">2012</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgradstein2012">Gradstein et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgradstein2012">2012</a>). Technological advances in mass spectrometry, such as the widespread

availability of multi-collector instruments, are ever increasing the precision of the isotopic data that form the basis
of the chronostratigraphic timescale. A plethora of mathematical-statistical techniques are available to extract
chronological constraints from these isotopic measurements. Examples of this include isochrons, concordia diagrams,
age spectra and density estimates. Implementing these methods in a rigorous and self-consistent manner requires
appropriate software. For many years, a <span 
class="cmtt-10">Microsoft Excel </span>add-in called <span 
class="cmtt-10">Isoplot </span>has served this purpose extremely
well.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   Developed by Kenneth R. Ludwig over a period of two decades, <span 
class="cmtt-10">Isoplot </span>is a user-friendly toolbox
that allows geologists to calculate and visualise geochronological data within a familiar spreadsheet
environment (<a 
href="#Xludwig1988">Ludwig</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xludwig1988">1988</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xludwig1999">1999</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xludwig2003">2003a</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xludwig2012">2012</a>). Few computer programs have been as widely used in the
Earth Sciences as <span 
class="cmtt-10">Isoplot</span>. Written in Visual Basic for Applications (<span 
class="cmtt-10">VBA</span>), <span 
class="cmtt-10">Isoplot </span>takes isotopic data
as input and produces publication-ready figures as output. Unfortunately, recent versions of <span 
class="cmtt-10">Excel</span>
are incompatible with <span 
class="cmtt-10">Isoplot</span>, whose creator has retired and no longer maintains the code. These
software issues are a major problem for the field of radiometric geochronology, to the point where some
laboratories keep an old <span 
class="cmtt-10">Windows</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">&#x00A0;XP </span>computer with <span 
class="cmtt-10">Excel</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">&#x00A0;2003 </span>around for the sole purpose of running
<span 
class="cmtt-10">Isoplot</span>.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   This paper introduces a new computer code called <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>as a free, open and more future-proof alternative
for <span 
class="cmtt-10">Isoplot</span>. The principal aim of this paper is to provide a general overview of the design philosophy and basic
operating principles behind the software, rather than a detailed manual of all its components. Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-20002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:architecture --></a> discusses
the software architecture, which uses a modular design with future-proofness and extendability in mind. Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-30003">3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:input --></a>
presents three fundamental types of input format that are used by <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>to capture the covariance structure of
isotopic ratio data. We will see that this covariance structure plays a fundamental role in all of <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR</span>&#8217;s
methods.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-40004">4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:regression --></a> reviews the important subject of linear regression, which underpins the construction of isochrons.
<span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>currently implements three different types of error weighted linear regression algorithms that account for
error correlations between variables and between aliquots in two or three dimensions. Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-50005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:overdispersion --></a> explains how these
three methods represent different approaches of dealing with overdispersion. Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-60006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:averaging --></a> introduces a weighted mean
plot to visualise multiple age estimates and proposes a heuristic method to detect outliers. Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-70007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:confidence --></a>
presents three approaches to construct confidence intervals for isochron ages, weighted means and
so forth. It introduces a profile log-likelihood method for the calculation of asymmetric confidence
intervals.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >   Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-80008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:density --></a> discusses three further methods to visualise multi-aliquot collections of ages. Cumulative age
distributions (CADs) and kernel density estimates (KDEs) show the frequency distribution of the age measurements
but do not explicitly take into account the analytical uncertainties. The radial plot is introduced as a more
appropriate data visualisation tool for &#8216;heteroscedastic&#8217; data (i.e. data with unequal measurements uncertainties).
The radial plot provides a good vehicle to assess the dispersion of multi-aliquot datasets. Overdispersed
datasets require further processing with continuous or discrete mixture models that are discussed in
Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-90009">9<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:mixtures --></a>.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 123--><p class="indent" >   Sections&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-1000010">10<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:PD --></a>-<a

href="#x1-1600016">16<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:detritals --></a> introduces a selection of statistical methods to help
interpret collections of multiple geochronological datasets that are useful in detrital geochronology.
Finally, Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-1700017">17<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:future --></a> sets out a roadmap for future developments to improve the accuracy and precision of
geochronological data, and to provide closer integration of <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>with earlier steps of the data processing
chain.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Software architecture</h3>
<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >There are three ways to use <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR</span>: online, offline and from the command line.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 140--><p class="indent" >   The online version can be accessed at <span 
class="cmtt-10">http://isoplotr.london-geochron.com </span>(see Appendix&#x00A0;A), and is
convenient in several ways. First, it requires no software installation. Second, the <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>website is perfectly
platform-independent. It renders on any modern HTML-5 compatible web browser, including those installed on
smartphones and tablet computers. Third, by using the online version, the user is guaranteed to have accessed the
most up-to-date version of the software.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 149--><p class="indent" >   An offline version of the GUI is provided for use on computers that are not (permanently) connected
to the internet. This is often the case for machines that are connected to mass spectrometers, as a
safety precaution. The offline version of the GUI works by emulating a web server within the default
browser on the user&#8217;s system. Installation instructions are provided on the <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>website and on
<span 
class="cmtt-10">GitHub</span>.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 157--><p class="indent" >   The third way to access the full functionality of <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>is through the command line within the <span 
class="cmtt-10">R</span>
programming environment (see Appendix&#x00A0;B). The command line offers the greatest flexibility to automate, modify
and extend <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR</span>&#8217;s functionality.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 162--><p class="indent" >   The code base for the GUI and the core data processing algorithms are surgically separated. The command-line
functionality is grouped in a lightweight package called <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>that may be installed from the &#8216;Comprehensive R
Archive Network&#8217; (CRAN) by typing <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">install.packages('IsoplotR')</span></span></span> at the command prompt. Once installed, the
package can be loaded into memory by typing <span 
class="cmtt-10">library(IsoplotR)</span>. The <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>package has minimal
dependencies and should work on a basic <span 
class="cmtt-10">R </span>installation. In contrast, the GUI is written in <span 
class="cmtt-10">HTML </span>and <span 
class="cmtt-10">Javascript </span>and
interacts with <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>via an interface package (<a 
href="#Xchang2017">Chang et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xchang2017">2017</a>). It is provided in a second <span 
class="cmtt-10">R </span>package called
<span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotRgui </span>that is available from <span 
class="cmtt-10">GitHub </span>(see the <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>website for details). <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotRgui </span>is separate from
but depends on <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR</span>.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 177--><p class="indent" >   The clean separation between the two programs allows <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>to remain light and easy to install. This is
important for any future <span 
class="cmtt-10">R </span>packages that may wish to incorporate <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>functions. A second reason for keeping
the code base of the GUI and command line functionality separated is that other user interfaces are
planned, for example within <span 
class="cmtt-10">Excel </span>(Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-1700017">17<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:future --></a>). Incorporating all these additional functions into a
single package would add unnecessary bulk and redundancy. <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>and <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotRgui </span>are free and
open software. The computer code for both programs is made available under the GPL license, which
permits re-use and modification provided that any derived code is released under the same conditions
(<a 
href="#Xgplv3">Free&#x00A0;Software&#x00A0;Foundation</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgplv3">2007</a>).

<!--l. 214--><p class="indent" >   Regardless of the application, the error propagation of <span

(<a 
href="#Xludwig2003">Ludwig</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xludwig2003">2003a</a>). Without analytical uncertainties, it is impossible to ascertain whether the difference between two
geochronological dates is real, or simply an artifact of analytical imprecision. <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>propagates the analytical
uncertainty of <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>using one of two methods. If <span 
class="cmmi-10">F </span>is a likelihood function, then the error propagation is done by
inverting the (negative) matrix of its second derivatives. In all other cases, the error propagation uses a first order
Taylor approximation:

<!--l. 364--><p class="noindent" >Isochrons are an important instrument of high precision, high accuracy geochronology. Given several aliquots from a
single sample, they allow the non-radiogenic component of the daughter nuclide to be quantified and separated from
the radiogenic component. In its simplest form, an isochron is obtained by setting out the amount of radiogenic
daughter against the amount of radioactive parent, both normalised to a non-radiogenic isotope of the daughter
element, and fitting a straight line through these points by least squares regression (<a 
href="#Xnicolaysen1961">Nicolaysen</a>,&#x00A0;<a

and intercept then yield the radiogenic daughter-parent ratio and the non-radiogenic daughter composition,
respectively.<br

<!--l. 376--><p class="indent" >   There are several ways to fit an isochron. The easiest of these is ordinary least squares regression, which weights
all data points equally. In the presence of quantifiable analytical uncertainty, it is equally straightforward to use the

x- and y-variable. The <a

<!--l. 768--><p class="indent" >   The interpretation of CADs is straightforward but not very intuitive. The prominence of individual age
components is proportional to the steepness of the CAD (Figure&#x00A0;<a

estimates such as histograms, in which such components stand out as peaks (Figure&#x00A0;<a

to identify than inflection points and this is probably why CADs are not more widely used as a data

smoothing and cannot as easily be combined as CADs. <span

<!--l. 860--><p class="indent" >   It is helpful to draw a radial scale at some convenient distance from the origin and annotating it with labelled
ticks at the appropriate angles. While the angular position of each data point represents the date, its horizontal
distance from the origin is proportional to the precision. Imprecise measurements plot on the left-hand side of the
radial plot, whereas precise age determinations are found further towards the right. Thus, radial plots
allow the observer to assess both the magnitude and the precision of quantitative data in one glance

class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>offers the option to force all panels to use the same kernel
bandwidth, to normalise the area under each KDE to a common value, and to plot them all on the same
timescale.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 1731--><p class="indent" >   Visual comparison of CADs or KDEs can be an effective way to spot general trends and groupings in simple
datasets. But this approach becomes impractical when the inter-sample differences are subtle or the datasets are
large (<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x003E; </span>10 samples, say). Such cases call for an additional layer of statistical simplification to emphasise the

geologically significant differences whilst removing the less informative similarities. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS)
is one way to achieve this goal.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 1740--><p class="indent" >   MDS is a dimension-reducting technique that takes a matrix of pairwise &#8216;dissimilarities&#8217; between objects (in our
case age distributions) as input and produces a &#8216;map&#8217; as output, on which similar samples cluster closely together
and dissimilar samples plot far apart (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-160012">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:2 --></a>.f). In the context of detrital geochronology, the dissimilarity between
samples is given by the statistical distance between age distributions. There are many ways to define this
statistical distance (<a 
href="#Xvermeesch2018b">Vermeesch</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvermeesch2018b">2018b</a>). <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic due to its
simplicity and the fact that it behaves like a true distance in the mathematical sense of the word
(<a 
href="#Xvermeesch2013">Vermeesch</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvermeesch2013">2013</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvermeesch2018b">2018b</a>).<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 1752--><p class="indent" >   The KS-distance is closely related to the CAD-plot that was discussed in Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-80008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:density --></a>. It is given by the maximum
vertical difference between two CAD step functions. Calculating the KS-distance between samples two at a time
populates a symmetric dissimilarity matrix with positive values and a zero diagonal. <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>implements two
algorithms to convert this matrix into an MDS configuration. The first (&#8216;classical&#8217; or &#8216;metric&#8217;) approach uses a
sequence of basic matrix manipulations developed by <a 
href="#Xyoung1938">Young and Householder</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xyoung1938">1938</a>) and <a 
href="#Xtorgerson1952">Torgerson</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xtorgerson1952">1952</a>) to
achieve a linear fit between the KS-distances and the fitted distances in the MDS configuration. The second, more
sophisticated (&#8216;nonmetric&#8217;) approach subjects the input distances to a transformation <span 
class="cmmi-10">f </span>prior to fitting a
configuration:

href="#Xkruskal1978">1978</a>). Fitting an MDS configuration then involves finding the disparity transformation that maximises the
goodness of fit (or minimises the &#8216;stress&#8217;) between the disparities and the fitted distances. The latter two
quantities can also be plotted against each other as a &#8216;Shepard plot&#8217;. Additional options and higher order

<!--l. 1814--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>is, and always will be, a work in progress. The program will continue to evolve because geochronology
itself continues to evolve. Future additions may include techniques such as K-Ar, K-Ca, luminescence- and
cosmogenic nuclide dating. New approaches to existing methods, such as LAICPMS-based fission track dating or
in-situ U-Th-He geochronology may prompt the addition of new input formats or novel approaches to data
visualisation. Additional user interfaces are planned to facilitate the integration of <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR </span>with existing
workflows in other programming environments. One example of this is the planned development of an
<span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR4Excel </span>add-in that will aim to provide the same user experience as K. Ludwig&#8217;s original <span 
class="cmtt-10">Isoplot</span>
program.
<!--l. 1827--><p class="indent" >   As was discussed in Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-30003">3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:input --></a>, rigorous error propagation requires statistical models that keep track of the error
correlations between isotopic ratio measurements. The regression algorithms of <a 
href="#Xyork1969">York</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xyork1969">1969</a>), <a 
href="#Xludwig1994">Ludwig and
Titterington</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xludwig1994">1994</a>) and <a 
href="#Xludwig1998">Ludwig</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xludwig1998">1998</a>) take into account the covariant data structure that is embedded <span 
class="cmti-10">within </span>each
aliquot of a multi-aliquot set of mass spectrometer measurements. But they do not take into account the uncertainty
correlations that may exist <span 
class="cmti-10">between </span>aliquots. These correlations can be very significant due to the
detector calibrations and fractionation factors that are shared by all measurements made on the same
instrument.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 1839--><p class="indent" >   For example, <a 
href="#Xvermeesch2015b">Vermeesch</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xvermeesch2015b">2015</a>) showed that error correlations between subsequent heating steps within a
<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-9">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-9">39</span></sup>Ar-age spectrum can be as high as <span 
class="cmmi-10">&rho; &#x003E; </span>0<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>9. Ignoring these correlations when calculating isochrons or
weighted means results in imprecise and potentially inaccurate dates. The mathematical solution to this problem is
fairly straightforward. <a 
href="#Xludwig1998">Ludwig</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xludwig1998">1998</a>)&#8217;s maximum likelihood approach to U-Pb isochron regression with decay
constant uncertainties can serve as a template for a generalised approach to linear regression and
averaging.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 1850--><p class="indent" >   This approach would require a new class of input formats in which all the isotopic ratio measurements are
assembled into one large covariance structure along with all the parameters and calibration constants.
Similar methods have already been implemented in lower level data acquisition and processing software
such as <span 
class="cmtt-10">Ar-Ar</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_Redux </span>(<a 
href="#Xvermeesch2015b">Vermeesch</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvermeesch2015b">2015</a>) and <span 
class="cmtt-10">U-Pb</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_Redux</span>/<span 
class="cmtt-10">ET</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_Redux </span>(<a

href="#Xmclean2016">McLean
et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmclean2016">2016</a>). At the moment there is a disconnect between these programs and <span 
class="cmtt-10">IsoplotR</span>. Fortunately,
both <span 
class="cmtt-10">Ar-Ar</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_Redux </span>and <span

class="cmtt-10">_Redux</span>/<span 
class="cmtt-10">ET</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_Redux </span>are open source software. It is therefore possible to
extend their code base with functions to export processed data in a format that can be imported into
<span
