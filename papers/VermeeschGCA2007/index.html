 id="x1-10001"></a>INTRODUCTION</h3>
</div>
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   The (U-Th)/He thermochronometer is based on the <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-decay of <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">238</span></sup>U, <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">235</span></sup>U, <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">232</span></sup>Th and the often neglected <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">147</span></sup>Sm
in accessory minerals such as apatite, sphene and zircon. Of these minerals, apatite is by far the most used, because
of its relatively well-understood diffusive behavior and uniquely low closure temperature (<span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>70<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">o</span></sup>C; Wolf et al., 1996).
The radioactive parent (U and Th) and radiogenic daughter (<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">4</span></sup>He) are measured separately on different
types of mass spectrometer, and accurate ages are only possible if all parent and daughter nuclides are
accounted for. Fitzgerald et al. (2006) provide an excellent discussion of factors that might violate this
requirement, such as <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-ejection, mineral and fluid inclusions or He implantation by a U-Th rich matrix.
The present paper focuses on arguably the most important complication, which is associated with
mineral inclusions rich in U and/or Th. The most common <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-emitting mineral inclusions in apatite are

monazite and zircon (Farley and Stockli, 2002). Zircon contains up to 5000 ppm U and Th, while
Th-concentrations of monazite can be up to 30% (Deer et al, 1992). These inclusions eject He into the surrounding
apatite that is measured following degassing by heating with a laser or in a resistance furnace. However,
zircon inclusions in particular will not dissolve in the concentrated HNO<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">3</span></sub> commonly used to digest
apatites prior to U-Th analysis. Hence, a substantial fraction of the measured He may be &#8220;parentless&#8221;.
<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   In the following sections, we will first assess the severity of this problem through some simple order-of-magnitude
considerations. As a solution to the &#8220;parentless He problem&#8221;, we propose the dissolution of apatite and inclusions in
more aggressive acids, such as hot HF (Carter et al., 2004). However, this does not solve a second complication
associated with <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-emitting mineral inclusions, namely the way they complicate the <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-ejection correction. Typically,
<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-ejection corrections are made under the assumption of uniform U-Th concentration, but this assumption is clearly
violated in the presence of U-Th rich mineral inclusions. A mathematical study of this effect is given in Section <a 
href="#x1-30003">3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:math --></a>.
Besides complicating the <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-ejection correction, inhomogeneous U-Th distributions also have an effect on the
diffusive behavior (closure temperature) of the radiogenic helium. Section <a 
href="#x1-40004">4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:Tc --></a> will illustrate that this is a relatively
minor effect. Therefore, the HF-dissolution technique might also be applicable to slowly cooled rocks (e.g., 1
<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">o</span></sup>C/Ma). However, several studies have reported unresolved problems with slowly cooled rocks, including
large data scatter (Fitzgerald, 2006) and (U-Th)/He ages older than fission track ages (Soderlund et
al, 2005; Green and Duddy, 2006). To avoid these problems, Section <a 
href="#x1-50005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:nax --></a> illustrates the effectiveness of
the HF-dissolution technique on inclusion-rich apatites from rapidly cooled rocks of Naxos (Greece).

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>PARENTLESS HELIUM AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING INCLUSION-FREE</h3>
<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Erroneous&#8221; apatite (U-Th)/He ages have often been attributed to U-Th rich mineral inclusions (e.g., Lippolt et al.,
1994; House et al., 1997; Fitzgerald et al., 2006). A very substantial part of many (U-Th)/He studies is spent on
selecting inclusion-free apatites under the binocular microscope. Under reflected and transmitted light, with or
without polarizers, grains are scrutinized for imperfections and mineral inclusions, in order to avoid the parentless
helium problem. But even when no inclusions can be detected with this method, it has been suggested that

sub-micron sized inclusions, only visible by electron microscopy or fission-track mapping for uranium inhomogeneity,
might produce significant amounts of parentless He (Farley and Stockli, 2002; Ehlers and Farley, 2003).
<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 138--><p class="indent" >   The validity of these concerns can be assessed by some simple order-of-magnitude calculations. Consider a
spherical apatite of radius R<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">a</span></sup> containing a spherical mineral inclusion with radius R<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">i</span></sup>. If the inclusion is 10 times
smaller than the apatite (R<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">i</span></sup> = R<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">a</span></sup>/10), then its cross-sectional area is 100 times smaller (A<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">i</span></sup>=A<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">a</span></sup>/100) and the
volume of the inclusion is 1000 times smaller than that of the host apatite (V<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">i</span></sup>=V<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">a</span></sup>/1000). In other words, an apatite
containing (an exceptionally low) 1 ppm U requires such an inclusion to be 1000 times more concentrated in
U (i.e. 1000 ppm) for it to produce an equal amount of He (Figure <a 
href="#x1-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:viva --></a>). Identical arguments hold for
non-spherical geometries. For example, consider a prismatic apatite with 10 ppm of U, containing an inclusion
that is 1% of its length, 1% of its width and 1% of its height. Such an inclusion has one millionth the
volume of the host grain (Figure <a 
href="#x1-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:viva --></a>). It would need to consist of pure uranium to increase the helium
by just 10%. Typical apatites used in thermochronology have dimensions on the order of 100 <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03BC;</span>m,
and U-Th concentrations <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>10 ppm (Farley, 2002). Zircon inclusions have U and Th concentrations of
typically 100-1000 ppm and sometimes up to 5000 ppm, whereas monazite can contain up to 30%
of Th (Deer et al., 1992). Therefore, sub-micron sized inclusions may be a less significant source of
parentless helium than previously thought, unless they are extremely numerous and their composite volume
is more than a ten-thousandth or so of the host apatite. We will now shift our attention away from
micro-inclusions and focus on somewhat larger inclusions which do contribute substantial amounts of parentless
helium.

class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-EJECTION CORRECTIONS</h3>
</div>
<!--l. 192--><p class="indent" >   In the previous section, we discussed the magnitude of the parentless helium problem for small mineral
inclusions. As will be demonstrated later, it is possible to avoid this problem altogether (even for relatively large
inclusions) by dissolving the apatites and their mineral inclusions in aggressive acids such as HF. However, this does
not solve a second problem, caused by the inhomogeneous U-Th concentrations associated with mineral inclusions.
<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-decay of U, Th and their radioactive daughters is associated with energies of 4-8 MeV (Farley et al., 1996).
<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-particles with such high energies travel on average 20 <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03BC;</span>m in apatite before coming to rest. Consider a spherical
apatite with radius R and an <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-emitting nuclide located at a radial distance X from its center. Let S be the
<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-stopping distance (e.g., 20 <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03BC;</span>m). <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-emitting nuclides located at a distance R-S<span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2264;</span>X<span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2264;</span>R have a non-zero
probability of ejecting an <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-particle outside the boundaries of the apatite grain (Figure <a 
href="#x1-30082">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:FtivsXstar --></a>). For any given
spatial distribution of U and Th, it is possible to predict the fraction (1-F<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">t</span></sub>) of radiogenic He lost by
<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-ejection (Farley et al., 1996; Meesters and Dunai, 2002; Hourigan et al. 2005). In most cases, the U-Th
distribution is not known and assumed to be uniform. This assumption often constitutes the bulk of the
analytical (U-Th)/He age uncertainty. If significant He is produced by small mineral inclusions, the
assumption of uniform composition is violated. We will address this problem mathematically for spherical
grain geometries. The physical dimension of the mineral inclusions will be neglected, i.e. they will be
considered point sources of <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-particles, making the He-retentivity of the inclusion itself irrelevant.

<!--l. 463--><p class="noindent" >Besides complicating the <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-ejection correction, the inhomogeneous U-Th-distribution inherent to inclusion-bearing
apatites also affects the diffusive behavior of the helium. This problem is well studied in the case of concentrically
zoned spherical crystals (Meesters and Dunai, 2002b). The &#8220;closure temperature&#8221; (defined below) of the (U-Th)/He
system depends on the spatial distribution of the helium. This does not constitute a significant problem for
relatively rapidly cooled rocks (e.g. <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x003E; </span>10 <sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">o</span></sup>C/Ma for rocks older than <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>10 Ma). However, for slowly cooled rocks,
the effect of mineral inclusions on helium diffusion might induce significant scatter in the apparent
ages, depending on the spatial distribution of the inclusions and their relative <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-emitting activity
(G-factor, equation <a 
href="#x1-3002r2">2<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:G --></a>), which are nearly impossible to measure. To get a handle on the significance of this
effect, this section will consider the &#8220;worst case scenario&#8221; of a spherical U-Th-free apatite containing an
<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-emitting micro-inclusion at its core or rim. Such a grain should have the most different diffusive behavior
compared to the default case of an inclusion-free apatite containing a homogeneous U-Th-distribution.
<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 484--><p class="indent" >   Before proceeding with the analysis, it is useful to recall the definition of &#8220;closure temperature&#8221; by Dodson
(1973). First consider the case of isothermal diffusion for a simple geochronometer defined by one radioactive parent
P (e.g., <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>K) decaying to a radiogenic daughter D (e.g., <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar). At high temperatures, the radiogenic daughter
escapes from mineral grains as soon as it is formed whereas at low temperatures, thermally activated diffusion is
negligible and the daughter products are quantitatively retained. Now consider the case of monotonic cooling. In the
high-temperature part of the cooling-curve, the D/P-ratio stays zero. Under transitional temperatures, the
D/P-ratio increases at a rate that increases with time. Finally, at low temperatures, D/P increases
linearly with time. The apparent age is the time intercept of the linear section of the D/P vs time
curve. This age corresponds to a particular temperature in the cooling history, the so-called &#8220;closure
temperature&#8221; T<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">c</span></sub>. If the cooling curve is linear in the temperature T, then the closure temperature (T<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">c</span></sub>)
is the temperature intercept of the linear section of the T vs D/P curve (Figure <a 
href="#x1-40016">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Tt --></a>). If the cooling
curve is linear in 1/T, then T<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">c</span></sub> can be calculated analytically (Dodson, 1973). Things are a little more
complicated for (U-Th)/He because there are not one but three radioactive parents (<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">238</span></sup>U, <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">235</span></sup>U, and <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">232</span></sup>Th)
with different half-lives, causing their relative contributions to change with time. However, the helium
content of young rocks does increase linearly with time to a very good approximation (t <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2248; </span>[He]/<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03C0;</span>
with <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03C0; </span>as defined in equation <a 
href="#x1-3003r3">3<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:pi --></a>). Therefore, the closure temperature concept can also be used for

(U-Th)/He. Because we are interested in the relationship between mineral inclusions and cooling rate
(dT/dt), we will assume linear cooling (dT/dt = constant with t). We will not calculate T<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">c</span></sub> using
Dodson&#8217;s approximate analytical solution (an exact solution is only possible if T <span

versus apparent (U-Th)/He age (Figure <a

Dunai, 2002a &amp; b) and the spherical symmetry, a concentrated <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-emitting inclusion is mathematically equivalent to
a thin spherical shell at the same distance of the rim (A.G.C.A. Meesters, written communication,
July 2006). A spherical shell of a certain U-Th concentration produces as much He as a half-shell
with twice, or a quarter-shell with four times this U-Th concentration. By induction it follows that a
U-Th rich spherical shell is equivalent to a point source of equal <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-emitting activity located at the
same distance from the rim. Therefore, individual inclusions can be adequately modeled as spherical
shells in DECOMP. The &#8220;worst case scenario&#8221; of a single <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-emitting micro-inclusion located in the
center of a U-Th-free apatite was modeled in DECOMP by a spherical zone of 1 <span

all the U and Th, contained in a much larger spherical host apatite (e.g., R = 60 <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03BC;</span>m in Figure <a

whereas an inclusion located on the rim of such an apatite was modeled by a spherical shell of 1 <span

thickness. Given a user-defined cooling curve (10 <sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">o</span></sup>C/Ma for Figure <a 
href="#x1-40016">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Tt --></a>), DECOMP forward-models the
apparent age through time using an eigenmode-decomposition method (Meesters and Dunai, 2002a &amp; b).
In this paper, we used 100 eigenmodes. The apparent age increases linearly with time in the lower
temperature part of the linear cooling model (Figure <a 
href="#x1-40016">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Tt --></a>). As expected, the linear section of the T-t curve
begins at higher temperatures for the apatite containing an inclusion at its core than for inclusion-free
apatite. Intuitively, this makes sense because the helium produced by the inclusion must &#8220;travel further&#8221;
before reaching the edge of the apatite. The opposite is true for apatites with an inclusion on their rim.

in nature. As explained in Section <a

because their relative volume is small and the U-Th content of apatite is never zero. Consider the more
realistic scenario of a mineral inclusion contributing 50% of the total helium (G = 0.5). Because of the
superposition principle, such an inclusion will change the closure temperature by only 2.5-5 <sup><span

should also be possible to apply the HF-dissolution method to slowly cooled rocks. However, several

al., 2006) and (U-Th)/He ages older than apatite fission track ages (Soderlund et al., 2005; Green

<!--l. 618--><p class="noindent" >From the archive of apatite fission-track samples at ETH-Z&uuml;rich, we chose a sample that was both rapidly cooled
and full of large mineral inclusions. The sample, NAX-3, comes from the migmatite core on the eastern side of
Naxos. In fact, apatites from NAX-3 contain so many inclusions that it was quite challenging to date them using the
fission-track method. Due to the U bearing inclusions which form &#8220;stars&#8221; on the mica solid state track recorders
(Figure <a 
href="#x1-50018">8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:FTmount&print --></a>), clear grains had to be chosen with care. Nevertheless, a fission-track age of 9.5 <span

using the <span

href="#x1-50029">9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:NAX3radial --></a>.a). The U-concentration of the
apatites was determined to be <span

(2004) from the same migmatite at 9.7 <span

whereas the (U-Th)/He age is based on the three-dimensional, volumetric U-Th-He content of the apatite.
To estimate the effect of these inclusions on the (U-Th)/He age, and assuming that the inclusions are 10%
of the length of the host apatite, one would effectively have to divide the number of fission tracks in the

recovered from the laser pan, partially opened under the binocular microscope, and dropped into teflon

2005), we had to recover the Pt packets before HF treatment. Using Nb foil envelopes would have
been an alternative solution (Reiners, 2005). In nearly half of the cases, dropping the samples into
the teflon bombs caused the apatite(s) to fall out of their partially opened packet. These grains were

(Element2, Thermo Electron Corporation, Bremen, Germany). The results are summarized in Table <a

inspection of the data reveals that the spread of the zircon inclusion-bearing grain ages is much larger for the HNO<sub><span

treated grains than for those treated with HF (Figure <a 
href="#x1-50029">9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:NAX3radial --></a>.b). The former are up to 45 Ma old, whereas the latter
cluster more tightly and are closer to the fission-track age. Using the grain dimensions that were measured
for the <span

class="cmsy-10">~</span>5
and <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>10ppm for the HNO<sub><span

HF-treated single grain samples are between 9 and 13 Ma, consistent with the sharp mode of Figure <a 
href="#x1-30154">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:PFt2D --></a>. As
discussed in the previous section, the average age of multiple inclusion-bearing apatites should be an
accurate estimate of the true age. To compare and combine the single grain measurements with the
multi-grain measurements, we introduce a &#8220;pooled (U-Th)/He age&#8221;, which effectively is a weighted
mean age obtained by adding the U and Th of several individual analyses, as well as their He-content
(weighted for <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-ejection), and calculating a synthetic multi-grain age. The pooled age of the HNO<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">3</span></sub>-treated
inclusion-bearing grains is 22.6 Ma, whereas the HF-treated pooled age is 10.9 Ma, which is identical
to the pooled (U-Th)/He age of the four inclusion-free apatite analyses. Note that the (U-Th)/He
age of one of these four inclusion-free ages is nearly twice as old as the other three. Because we have
no indication as to what is the cause of this, we chose not to reject the measurement. However, if
the measurement is removed as being unrepresentative the resulting age is 9.2 Ma. Fitzgerald et al.
(2006) also observed single grain ages that were several times older than &#8220;normal&#8221;. Perhaps one of the
factors discussed by these authors is responsible for this, or a yet unknown complication is at work. As
discussed in Section <a 
href="#x1-30003">3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:math --></a> and shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-30175">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:sigmaFtvsSr --></a>, the spread of HF-treated multi-grain samples should be less
than that of the single grain ages. The relative 2<span

inclusion-bearing grains of 100 <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03BC;</span>m width (equivalent to S/R <span

confirmed by the five multi-grain measurements of Table <a

</div>
<!--l. 859--><p class="indent" >   Simple dimensional considerations indicate that single uranium-rich inclusions less than a few percent of the
length, width and height of the host apatite are unlikely to contribute substantial radiogenic helium. For larger
inclusions or multiple small inclusions, the parentless helium problem can be partially solved by more
aggressive acid dissolution procedures. Under the assumption of uniformly distributed mineral inclusions,
the average (U-Th)/He age of many inclusion-rich apatites that have undergone such a treatment is
accurate. Please note that the assumption of a random distribution can more easily be verified in
the presence of large inclusions (e.g., Figure <a 
href="#x1-500310">10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:W1 --></a>) than for micro-inclusions or a compositionally zoned
apatite. Grain-selection is significantly faster and easier without the restriction to inclusion-free grains.
For some samples, it is nearly impossible to find inclusion-free grains. Further, by broadening the
search to include inclusion-bearing grains, it is much easier to find large, euhedral apatites, requiring
relatively small <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-ejection corrections. Additionally, the presence of U-Th rich inclusions may be an
advantage for dating young rapidly cooled rocks. Multi-grain measurements of inclusion-bearing apatites
combine the best of two worlds. They have the high U, Th and He content of zircon, but the diffusive
behavior and uniquely low closure temperature of apatite. This is similar to the idea behind the work of
Min et al. (2006), who dated volcanic olivine and pyroxene using the He produced by the <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-emitting
inclusions contained within them. On the other hand, dissolving U-Th rich inclusions also causes some
complications, particularly for single-grain dating. The probability distribution of single grain ages has heavy
tails.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 887--><p class="indent" >   The revised methodology has applications to all rock-types which have inclusion-bearing apatites. However, in
most studies, only a few grains are usually dated and it is often possible to find two or three suitable clear crystals.
For detrital source studies however, this is not the case because in such studies many more grains
are necessary to characterize the population. The difficulty of finding enough inclusion-free grains
that represent a realistic and representative cross section of the populations can only be made by also

including some of the inclusion-bearing apatites. Although the precision of single grain (U-Th)/He ages on
inclusion-bearing apatites is worse than the precision of inclusion-free apatite (U-Th)/He ages, it is
comparable to or better than the precision of detrital apatite fission track ages. Thus we recommend that
for detrital studies using apatite analysis the more aggressive dissolution method is used routinely.
