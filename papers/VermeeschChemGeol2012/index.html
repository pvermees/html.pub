<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >Since the development of SIMS and LA-ICP-MS technology in the 1980s and
1990s, single grain U-Pb dating of detrital zircon has quickly become the most
popular technique for sedimentary provenance studies. Currently by far the most
widespread method for visualising detrital age distributions is the so-called
Probability Density Plot (PDP), which is calculated by summing a number of
Gaussian distributions whose means and standard deviations correspond to the
individual ages and their respective analytical uncertainties. Unfortunately, the
PDP lacks a firm theoretical basis and can produce counter-intuitive results when
data quantity (number of analyses) and/or quality (precision) is high. As a more
robust alternative to the PDP, this paper proposes a standard statistical
technique called Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), which also involves summing
a set of Gaussian distributions, but does not explicitly take into account
the analytical uncertainties. The Java-based <span 
class="cmtt-12">DensityPlotter </span>program
(<span 
class="cmtt-12"><a href="http://densityplotter.london-geochron.com">http://densityplotter.london-geochron.com</a></span>) was developed with the
aim to facilitate the adoption of KDE plots in the context of detrital

geochronology.

<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >Zircon (ZrSiO<sub><span 
class="cmr-8">4</span></sub>) is a common accessory mineral in acidic igneous rocks, which
form the main proto-sources of the siliciclastic sediments. It contains up to a
percent of radioactive U and Th, which decay to various isotopes of lead with
known half lives, forming the basis of the U-Th-Pb geochronometer. Zircon is
a very durable mineral that undergoes minimal chemical alteration or
mechanical abrasion. Therefore, zircon crystals can be considered time capsules
carrying the igneous and metamorphic history of their proto-sources.
The probability distribution of a representative sample of zircon U-Pb
ages from a detrital population can serve as a characteristic fingerprint
that may be used to trace the flow of sand through sediment routing
systems. As a provenance tracer, zircon U-Pb data are less susceptible to
winnowing effects than conventional petrographic techniques (<a 
href="#Xgarzanti2009">Garzanti
et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgarzanti2009">2009</a>). Using modern microprobe technology, it is quite easy to date, say,
a hundred grains of zircon in a matter of just a few hours. Due to the
robustness of zircons as a tracer of sedimentary provenance, and the relative
ease of dating them, the use of detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology has
truly exploded in recent years. A literature survey using the keywords
&#8216;detrital&#8217;, &#8216;zircon&#8217;, and &#8216;provenance&#8217; indicates that the proliferation of detrital
zircon studies has followed an exponential trend, with the number of

publications doubling roughly every five years over the past two decades. At
present, nearly a thousand detrital zircon publications appear each year.
<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   To address the technical and methodological issues arising from the increased
popularity of the technique, a detrital zircon geochronology workshop was held
immediately prior to the 2011 Goldschmidt conference in Prague. During this
workshop, a concensus was reached that the statistical tools used by the
community to analyse the vast amounts of U-Pb data produced by today&#8217;s SIMS
and LA-ICP-MS laboratories are inadequate. Particularly the use of so-called
Probability Density Plots (PDPs), which are ubiquitous in the detrital zircon
geochronology literature, was identified as a cause for concern. It was noted that,
in spite of its name, the PDP lacks any theoretical basis as a probability density
estimator, although some maintained that it may still serve a purpose as a data
visualisation tool. <a 
href="#Xgalbraith1998">Galbraith</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xgalbraith1998">1998</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgalbraith2010">2010</a>) eloquently pointed out some problems
with the PDP in the context of fission track and luminescence dating,
but unfortunately this work was published in specialised journals and
has not been picked up by the detrital zircon U-Pb dating community.
Furthermore, <a 
href="#Xgalbraith1990a">Galbraith</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xgalbraith1990a">1990</a>)&#8217;s alternative for the PDP, the so-called radial
plot, is not ideally suited for displaying large datasets of relatively precise
zircon U-Pb ages. This paper proposes the Kernel Density Estimator
(KDE), which has a similar appearance as the PDP, but is built on solid
theoretical foundations, as a statistically more robust alternative to the PDP
(Section <a 
href="#x1-20002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:kdevspdp --></a>). In order to aid in the adoption of this method by the detrital
zircon U-Pb dating community, a Java-based data visualisation tool called

<span

<!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   In contrast with the geochronology of igneous and metamorphic rocks, in
which one seeks to date an individual geological event, detrital studies
generally aim to characterise an entire population of ages by means of a
large number of single grain analyses. In statistical terms, the goal of
such studies is to estimate the so-called Probability Density Function
(PDF), which gives the relative likelihood of the different ages in the
population. By definition, the probability for a randomly selected grain to fall
within a given range is then given by the integral of the PDF over this
range:

determining the smoothness characteristics of the density estimate), but the
bandwidth is. Picking the wrong bandwidth may lead to density estimates
that are either over- or undersmoothed (Figure <a

either be constant (&#8216;kernel density estimation&#8217;), or vary according to the

rarely appropriate, yielding oversmoothed density estimates. Adaptive kernel
density estimates vary the bandwidth according to the local density. This means
that in areas where data density is sparse, a large bandwidth is used, and
the density estimate is smooth. But where lots of data are available, a
narrower bandwidth is used, allowing the KDE to provide a high resolution
estimate in those parts of the distribution. A large number of methods

<!--l. 198--><p class="noindent" >KDEs are commonly used in many branches of Science, but not in the context of
detrital geochronology. Instead, a similar-looking, but fundamentally different tool
named &#8216;Probability Density Plot&#8217; (PDP, Ludwig, 2003, also called Probability
Density Distribution by Sircombe, 2004), has gained significant popularity. The
PDP was first proposed by <a 
href="#Xhurford1984">Hurford et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xhurford1984">1984</a>), in an attempt to account for
the variable analytical precision (a.k.a. &#8216;heteroscedasticity&#8217;) of (detrital fission
track) data. Just like the KDE, the PDP is also produced by stacking a Normal
distribution on top of each measurement whose bandwidth, however, is not
determined by the density, but by the analytical precision (Figure <a 
href="#x1-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:KDEvsPDP --></a>.b), so as to
reduce the importance of imprecise measurements and to emphasize the precise
measurements. Although this may seem like a sensible strategy at first glance, it
may actually degrade results in certain situations, as illustrated with the following
two synthetic examples.
<!--l. 215--><p class="indent" >
      <ol  class="enumerate1" >
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4002x1">Consider  a  bimodal  distribution  of  &#8216;true  ages&#8217;  (i.e.,  the  probability
      distribution of an exhaustive sample of infinitely precise measurements)
      where the first peak (500<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">&plusmn;</span>50 Ma) contains one third and the second
      peak (2000<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">&plusmn;</span>50 Ma) two thirds of the detrital population (Figure <a 
href="#x1-40053">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:problems --></a>.a).
      Suppose that our measurements are infinitely precise. In this case, the
      KDE of a representative sample of single grain measurements is an
      unbiased estimator of the true age distribution (Figure <a 
href="#x1-40053">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:problems --></a>.b). The PDP,

      however, breaks down into a sequence of &#8216;spikes&#8217; (Figure <a 
href="#x1-40053">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:problems --></a>.c).
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4004x2">In reality, geochronological measurements are always convoluted with
      analytical uncertainty, making it very hard to recover the true age
      distribution (<a 
href="#Xcarroll1988">Carroll and Hall</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xcarroll1988">1988</a>). A more realistic aim of detrital
      studies  is  to  estimate  the  &#8216;measurement  distribution&#8217;,  which  is  a
      smoothed version of the true age distribution. As a second example,
      suppose that the age measurements of the aforementioned synthetic
      population are heteroscedastic, with the two modes having analytical
      uncertainties  of  50Ma  and  200Ma,  respectively.  As  a  result  of  the
      heteroscedasticity,  the  second  mode  will  be  smoothed  to  a  greater
      extent  than  the  first,  resulting  in  a  reversal  of  the  apparent  peak
      heights (Figure <a 
href="#x1-40053">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:problems --></a>.d). Once again, the KDE converges to the correct
      solution  with  increasing  number  of  age  measurements  (Figure  <a 
href="#x1-40053">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:problems --></a>.e).
      The  PDP,  however,  oversmooths  the  measurement  distribution  and
      gives the wrong answer, even after 10,000 measurements (Figure <a 
href="#x1-40053">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:problems --></a>.f).
      This is because the PDP &#8216;punishes&#8217; the imprecise ages twice (once by
      sampling/measuring, and once by smoothing). The key point here is
      that it is not necessary to explicitly account for the analytical precision
      in the density estimation because Nature, and the analytical process
      itself, have already taken care of this.

<!--l. 292--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmtt-12">DensityPlotter </span>is a computer program developed with the aim to facilitate the
adoption of the KDE by the geochronological community. It is based on
<span 
class="cmtt-12">RadialPlotter </span>which, as the name suggests, implements Rex Galbraith&#8217;s radial
plots for the fission track and luminescence communities (<a 
href="#Xvermeesch2009c">Vermeesch</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvermeesch2009c">2009</a>).
Both <span 
class="cmtt-12">RadialPlotter </span>and <span 
class="cmtt-12">DensityPlotter </span>were programmed in Java and
are therefore perfectly platform independent. <span 
class="cmtt-12">DensityPlotter </span>can be
downloaded from <span 
class="cmtt-12">http://densityplotter.london-geochron.com</span>. To
calculate the optimal KDE bandwidth, the program implements an algorithm
based on the diffusion equation, which can be shown to be both fast and
accurate (<a 
href="#Xbotev2010">Botev et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xbotev2010">2010</a>). In addition to KDEs (and radial plots),
<span 
class="cmtt-12">DensityPlotter </span>also provides functionality to plot histograms and PDPs, as well
as basic mixture models (<a 
href="#Xsambridge1994">Sambridge and Compston</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xsambridge1994">1994</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgalbraith1990b">Galbraith
and Green</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgalbraith1990b">1990</a>). Data can be copied and pasted to-and-from Microsoft
Excel and saved in a simple comma-separated variable (<span 
class="cmtt-12">.csv</span>) format. An
example of such an input file is provided on the website. The graphical
output can be saved either as bitmap or vector images, in a <span 
class="cmtt-12">.png </span>or <span 
class="cmtt-12">.pdf</span>
format, respectively. Although <span 
class="cmtt-12">DensityPlotter </span>was designed to produce
publication-ready figures and includes many options to customise the
look and feel of the density estimates, the pdf file can also be further
edited in vector-graphics applications such as Illustrator, CorelDRAW,
or Inkscape. Because the analytical precision of many geochronological

datasets is proportional to the age, the relative errors generally show less
grain-to-grain variability than the absolute errors. To take advantage
of this, <span 
class="cmtt-12">DensityPlotter </span>includes an option to log-transform the data
(<a 
href="#Xbrandon1996">Brandon</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xbrandon1996">1996</a>). The algorithm used for the mixture modelling is a hybrid one
using both deterministic parts (taken from&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgalbraith1990b">Galbraith and Green</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgalbraith1990b">1990</a>) and
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ingredients to maximise robustness
and reproducibility. The reader is referred to the Help pages for further
implementation details about the program. For access to the source code, see the
website.

 id="x1-60004"></a>A concluding example</h3>
<!--l. 330--><p class="noindent" >This paper showed that the PDP lacks the firm theoretical basis of the KDE. The
former produces noisy results when applied to high precision data, and yields
oversmoothed density estimates when analytical precision is low and/or sample
size is large. The question then arises why the PDP has become so popular in
geochronology in the first place. To answer this question, consider the dataset of
zircon U-Pb ages from a Mesozoic sandstone from Hong Kong shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-60014">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:densityplotter --></a>
and posted on the <span 
class="cmtt-12">DensityPlotter </span>website. Figure <a 
href="#x1-60014">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:densityplotter --></a>.a shows the density
estimates of the full dataset of 145 concordant U-Pb ages, while Figure
<a 
href="#x1-60014">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:densityplotter --></a>.b shows a subset of 35 randomly selected ages from the same sample.
The KDE (blue, filled) of the full dataset looks similar to that of the
subsample, featuring a first major peak at <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">~</span>1000 Ma and a second mode
at <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">~</span>2500 Ma. The PDPs (black, empty) of the two datasets, however,

have quite a different appearance. Although the PDP of the full dataset
is undeniably undersmoothed in comparison with the KDE, it does a
decent job at capturing both of the major peaks, as well as most of the
smaller scale features. The PDP of the subsample, however, has broken
down into an assemblage of spikes bearing little or no resemblance to the
KDE. This PDP may still serve a purpose as a way to visualise the data.
Unfortunately PDPs are seldom used in this way. Because of their very name,
they are erroneously used and interpreted as estimators of probability
density.<br

random subset of 35 ages from the same sample. In both cases, the PDP
suffers from undersmoothing. Both KDEs adequately capture the bimodality
of the distribution, and so does the PDP of the full dataset. The PDP of the
subset, however, breaks down into a number of spikes marking the individual
age measurements, while obscuring the underlying probability distribution.</span></div><!--tex4ht:label?: x1-60014 -->

<!--l. 367--><p class="indent" >   </div><hr class="endfigure">
<!--l. 369--><p class="indent" >   In order for a PDP to match the corresponding KDE and be useful as a
probability density estimator, the analytical precision of the ages would have to
equal the bandwidth of the KDE. For this to happen, the underlying age
distribution would have to be made of a number of peaks which are slightly
wider than the (2<span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x03C3;</span>) measurement errors. In statistical terms, the variance
of the different age components of the detrital population would have
to be twice the variance of the age measurements, so that the observed
scatter of the age measurements around the different age components
would be overdispersed with respect to the formal analytical precision
by a factor of <img 
src="PDPvsKDE9x.png" alt="&#x221A; --
  2"  class="sqrt" >. It appears that this condition is approximately and
fortuitously fulfilled by typical U-Pb datasets featuring <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">~</span>100 ages of 2-5%
analytical precision. The &#8216;reasonable&#8217; appearance of many published PDPs
is therefore caused by chance and not by design, and this is the likely
explanation for their enduring popularity in the geological literature. Despite
the fact that PDPs may be considered &#8216;good enough&#8217; as a visual aid in
many situations, in other cases they may be noninformative at best, and
misleading at worst. The KDE is a valid alternative with solid theoretical
underpinnings which combines the best features of the PDP (namely a continuous
curve that is easy to interpret) without its failings when data quality
or quantity are high. It is hoped that <span 
class="cmtt-12">DensityPlotter </span>will aid in the
adoption of the KDE by the Earth Sciences community, and the user is
invited to contact the author with remarks or requests for additional
features.
