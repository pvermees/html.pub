<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >Detrital thermochronology has been proposed as a method for measuring average basin-wide
erosion rates. This paper illustrates how to use detrital apatite fission track (AFT)
thermochronology to map out where in a basin erosion takes place. Five samples of detrital AFT
ages were collected on an alluvial fan that is fed by the Marble Creek drainage basin in the
northern White Mountains (California). Using a digital elevation model to characterize the
basin hypsometry and a few published basement samples to constrain the age-elevation
curve of the catchment, the detrital AFT distribution was predicted. Comparing the
observed with the predicted age distributions reveals that localized rock fall events
provide the sediment source of the currently active Marble Creek, but a composite sample
from the entire alluvial fan indicates that over longer timescales, the entire catchment
contributes material to the debris-flow dominated fan, with more material being derived from
lower elevations than from higher up the Marble Creek Canyon. The observed AFT age
distribution is compared with the hypsometric predictions using the &#8220;Cumulative Age
Distribution&#8221; (CAD) which is the cumulative distribution of the measured ages. In
contrast with probability density estimators and their cumulative equivalents, the CAD
requires no numerical smoothing while properly accounting for (unequal) measurement
uncertainties.

class="cmr-8">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-8">39</span></sup>Ar, fission track, (U-Th)/He) of exhumed fault blocks generally
increase with elevation. For catchments draining such terranes, it is possible to predict detrital age
distributions if the relationship between age and elevation is either assumed or known, if the
catchment hypsometry is known, and under some additional assumptions, which are discussed
below.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   A few studies have explored this for the <sup><span 
class="cmr-8">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-8">39</span></sup>Ar system. If erosion is in a steady state over
geologic time, then <sup><span 
class="cmr-8">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-8">39</span></sup>Ar cooling ages are expected to decrease linearly with depth, or increase
linearly with elevation. In a theoretical study, <span 
class="cmti-12">Stock and Montgomery </span>[1996] argue that, under the
assumption of a thermal gradient, the <span 
class="cmti-12">range </span>of detrital cooling ages can be used to estimate
(paleo-)relief. Going one step further, <span 
class="cmti-12">Brewer et al. </span>(2003) proposed a method to estimate average
basin-wide erosion rates by matching the <span 
class="cmti-12">shape </span>of detrital age distributions with the
area-elevation curve (= &#8220;hypsometry&#8221;) of the catchment. In a recent paper, <span 
class="cmti-12">Ruhl and Hodges</span>
[2005] introduced a hybrid approach using an extensive dataset of 692 detrital muscovite
<sup><span 
class="cmr-8">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-8">39</span></sup>Ar ages from four catchments in the Himalaya. Average basin-wide erosion rates were
estimated from the range of detrital cooling ages, while the shape of the detrital age
distributions was used to test the validity of several assumptions made by <span 
class="cmti-12">Stock and</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Montgomery </span>[1996] and <span 
class="cmti-12">Brewer et al. </span>[2003]: (1) the assumption of steady-state erosion and
topography, which is required for a predictable (typically linear) age-elevation curve, and (2)
the assumptions of uniform modern erosion rates, negligible sediment storage in the
catchment and adequate mixing of the sediments, which are necessary for the convolution of
this age-elevation curve with the catchment hypsometry, but may be invalidated by
inhomogeneous lithologies, structural geology or the presence or absence of vegetation.
<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   If these assumptions hold, <span 
class="cmti-12">Ruhl and Hodges </span>[2005] argue, then the hypsometric curve must
match the observed detrital age distribution. Strictly speaking, this does not mean that all
assumptions hold if and only if the hypsometry matches the measured detrital age distribution.
More importantly, if the measured age distribution does <span 
class="cmti-12">not </span>match the hypsometry, it is difficult to
assess which of the assumptions were violated and to what extent. In only one of <span 
class="cmti-12">Ruhl and</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Hodges</span>&#8217; [2005] four catchments did the measured match the predicted age distribution,
indicating that steady-state erosion might exist. For the other three catchments, it is unclear
whether this means that erosion and topography are not in steady-state, erosion rates
are not uniform or sediments are not well mixed. Is one problem responsible for all
catchments or are different assumptions violated in different catchments? For each of the
previous studies, the age-elevation relationship was unkown. If known, would that have
explained the mismatches that resulted from assuming a linear age-elevation relation? The
present paper avoids many of these questions in a carefully selected field area, where
assumption 1 is not necessary, enabling a semi-quantitative assessment of assumption 2. The
following sections will outline a method to map out the erosion rate distribution in a

watershed by looking at the frequency distribution of detrital fission track cooling ages in
apatite crystals derived from it. This idea was independently developed and published by
<span 
class="cmti-12">Stock et al. </span>[2006], who studied detrital (U-Th)/He ages from two catchments in the
eastern Sierra Nevada, on the opposite side of the Owens Valley. Although the basic
idea behind the work of <span 
class="cmti-12">Stock et al. </span>[2006] is identical to the present study, there are
important methodological differences in the way the data are interpreted (Section <a 
href="#x1-30002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:pdfcspdfcad --></a>).
<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   The method is illustrated in the context of a simple drainage basin in the White Mountains, an
eastward-tilted fault block on the California-Nevada border. The S-N trending White Mountains
fault block is bounded on the west by the White Mountains fault zone, which is dated at 12 Ma by
AFT and (U-Th)/He dating at different structural levels on the fault block [<span 
class="cmti-12">Stockli et al.</span>, 2000,
2003]. A mid-Miocene erosional unconformity found on the eastern flank of the northern White
Mountains is tilted <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">~ </span>25<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup> to the east [<span 
class="cmti-12">Stockli et al.</span>, 2000, 2003]. Linearly extrapolating this
Miocene paleo-surface would imply up to 8 km of normal displacement along the White
Mountains fault zone. The eastern boundary of the White Mountains is marked by the
dextral Fish Lake fault zone, which initiated at 6 Ma, and corresponds to the onset of
strike-slip motion on the Walker Lane Belt [<span 
class="cmti-12">Stewart</span>, 1988; <span 
class="cmti-12">Reheis and Dixon</span>, 1996;
<span 
class="cmti-12">Reheis and Sawyer</span>, 1997]. At 3 Ma, the White Mountains fault zone was reactivated
in an oblique right-lateral strike-slip sense, marking the progression of Walker Lane
tectonism from east to west [<span 
class="cmti-12">Stockli et al.</span>, 2003]. The dip-slip component of motion
was large enough that its signal can be recognized in the exhumed (U-Th)/He Partial
Retention Zone (PRZ) of the northern White Mountains [<span 
class="cmti-12">Stockli et al.</span>, 2000, 2003].

Zone (PAZ, Figure <a 
href="#x1-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:whitePAZ --></a>.a). Defining &#8220;paleodepth&#8221; as the perpendicular distance to the assumed tilted
mid-Miocene erosional surface, each paleodepth in Figure <a 
href="#x1-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:whitePAZ --></a>.a corresponds to a unique AFT age
and conversely, each AFT age corresponds to a unique paleodepth. AFT ages can be predicted by
computing the paleodepth for each pixel of a digital elevation model (DEM), and assigning
the corresponding AFT age to it. This is exactly how Figure <a 
href="#x1-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:whitePAZ --></a>.b was generated. The
paleodepth values of <span 
class="cmti-12">Stockli et al. </span>[2000] are based on the interpretation that a bedding dip in
the eastern White Mountains could be reliably projected across the range into space
(Figure <a 
href="#x1-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:whitePAZ --></a>.b). It is, however, possible that this surface was folded, potentially causing
significant uncertainties on the paleodepths. This would have little or no effect on the
reconstructed AFT age-distribution. Paleodepth is just used as an intermediate step between
AFT age and topography. Exactly via which numerical paleodepth-value an AFT age
is mapped to a topographic location is irrelevant, as long as the mapping is correct.

Detrital thermochronological data are usually represented by estimates of their probability density,
whose interpretation often involves deconvolution into Gaussian subpopulations [<span 
class="cmti-12">Galbraith and</span>
<span

class="cmti-12">Brandon</span>, 1996]. Cumulative distributions are an alternative to probability density
estimates that have recently gained considerable popularity [<span

2005; <span 
class="cmti-12">Ruhl and Hodges</span>, 2005; <span 
class="cmti-12">Hodges et al.</span>, 2005]. This paper introduces a new kind of
cumulative distribution which is slightly different from these previous studies. The reasons
why this so-called &#8220;Cumulative Age Distribution&#8221; is preferred to probability density
estimates and previous cumulative probability curves are discussed in the following section.

much the actual ages, but their probability distribution. Underlying any set of detrital ages is a
Probability Density Function (PDF), describing the probability of occurence of any detrital age

a finite sample of detrital ages (typically tens to hundreds of ages). Besides limited data,
measurement uncertainty is a second factor reducing the precision of density estimates. The most
popular estimators of probability density are histograms and &#8220;kernel density plots&#8221; [e.g.,
<span 
class="cmti-12">Silverman</span>, 1986]. Both of these methods apply some degree of &#8220;smoothing&#8221; to the data, either by
binning them into a histogram, or by assigning a Gaussian uncertainty distribution to each

measurement:

different approaches to detrital thermochronological density estimation, consider the
degenerate case of a &#8220;diving board&#8221; hypsometry: all detrital grains are derived from a single
elevation, corresponding to a single &#8220;true&#8221; age t<sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">true</span></sub>. The PDF of the true ages is a
delta-function (spike at t<sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">true</span></sub>, zero probability elsewhere). For further simplification, all
grains have identical, Gaussian measurement uncertainties. In the following, t<sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">true</span></sub> =
10Ma so all grains are 10Ma old and have Gaussian measurement uncertainties of 1Ma.

<!--l. 252--><p class="indent" >   Suppose we have access to an infinite number of measurement from this detrital population.

the specific case of a Gaussian kernel density estimator with <span

corresponding CDF is named the Cumulative Synoptic Probability Density Function (CSPDF).
Thus, the CSPDF is defined by using SPDF instead of PDF in Equation <a 
href="#x1-5001r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:pdfcdf --></a>. Although SPDF and

CSPDF are interchangeable from a statistical point of view, the CSPDF has recently gained
considerable popularity for two reasons. First, the cumulative distribution has intuitive
significance, as its shape mimics the shape of the the cumulative hypsometry (modulated by the
age-elevation curve). A second advantage of cumulative plots is the ease of comparing
different datasets by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) goodness-of-fit test. The K-S
test determines if the maximum vertical distance between two cumulative distributions
can be explained by random sampling effects alone. As illustrated by <span 
class="cmti-12">Amidon et al.</span>
[2005], using the CSPDF in combination with the K-S test is a useful tool for comparing
two detrital datasets. However, we will next see that the CSPDF should <span

for the purpose of comparing a detrital age distribution with hypsometric predictions.

 id="x1-60002.3"></a>The Cumulative Age Distribution (CAD)</h4>
<!--l. 428--><p class="noindent" >One of the most significant advantages of using cumulative distributions instead of probability
density estimates is not exploited by the CSPDF. Whereas it is impossible to visualize probability
densities without using at least some degree of smoothing (either by binning or by stacking
Gaussian kernels), this is not the case for cumulative distributions. The Cumulative Age
Distribution (CAD) is a discrete step-function with the sorted detrital age measurements on the
x-axis and their respective ranks on the y-axis (Figure <a 
href="#x1-50024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:cspdf50 --></a>). The (measured or &#8220;observed&#8221;) CAD is

class="cmsy-8">*</span><span

&#8220;predicted CAD&#8221;. <br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 441--><p class="indent" >   At first glance, it seems like the CAD does not properly account for variable measurement
uncertainties. The CSPDF explicitly takes into account analytical uncertainties (<img

<a 
href="#x1-4002r2">2<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:pdfhat --></a>), by &#8220;spreading out&#8221; imprecise measurements with wider Gaussian kernels. In contrast with this,
the observed CAD gives equal &#8220;weight&#8221; to all measurements. The observed CAD gets around the
need for kernel smoothing by shifting the uncertainty weighting to the predicted CAD. The
predicted CAD is computed from the hypsometry by simulating the detrital sampling process.
First, a number of synthetic <span 
class="cmti-12">ages </span>are generated from the hypsometry. Then, synthetic
measurement errors are added to each of these values, comparable in size to the real analytical
uncertainties. From these synthetic <span 
class="cmti-12">measurements</span>, a predicted CAD is calculated in
exactly the same way as the observed CAD. Thus, the measurement uncertainties are
properly accounted for by the predicted CAD, and there is no need to add them to
the observed CAD a second time. Note that the same procedure is also part of the
CSPDF-method, because the &#8220;predicted CAD&#8221; is essentially the same as <span

<!--l. 464--><p class="noindent" >In the toy example discussed before, all measurements had equal measurement uncertainties. This
is seldom the case in real world applications, particularly when fission track dating is involved.
Most importantly, AFT age uncertainties are a sensitive function of the number of spontaneous
fission tracks. Young grains have fewer spontaneous tracks than older grains of similar

U-concentration. This results in widely variable measurement uncertainties ranging from a few
percent for old, U-rich grains to more than 100% for U-poor grains containing little or no fission
tracks. As explained in the previous section, measurement uncertainties are incorporated in the
predicted, rather than the observed CAD. The problem of unequal measurement uncertainties can
be mitigated by using <span 
class="cmti-12">Brandon</span>&#8217;s [1996] logarithmic &#8220;z-transformation&#8221; (Equation <a

ages (t) are roughly proportional to the ratio of the expected number of spontaneous

rapidly with elevation. These ages will be under-represented in the detrital grain-age

sample ages corresponding to the lower part of the basement age-elevation curve. Older

<!--l. 631--><p class="indent" >   Apart from the measurement uncertainties inherent to the fission track method, additional
uncertainty is introduced by the finite sample size, 97-100 apatite grains for this study. This
ensures us that the largest population fraction that was not missed with 95% probability is less
than 6% of the total [<span 
class="cmti-12">Vermeesch</span>, 2004]. 5000 random replicates of the predicted CAD were
generated by repeatedly sampling 97-100 times from the predicted age distribution (white curve of

and challenging Himalayan field area, with relatively poorly known lithology and structural
geology. Because these conditions made it very hard to assess the potential impact of non-uniform
lithology and differential exhumation, these factors were not discussed in much detail. <span 
class="cmti-12">Ruhl and</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Hodges </span>[2005] list non-uniform lithology and differential uplift under their assumption 2. They
argue that if the observed CAD matches the hysometry, this can be seen as evidence for the
validity of these assumptions. In contrast with these previous studies, the White Mountains in
general, and the Marble Creek drainage in particular provide an excellent testing ground for
the CAD method, because both structure and lithology are simple. Nearly the entire
catchment is underlain by a single pluton, the Pelissier Flats monzo-granite, which
is bounded to the West by a single normal fault, but remains unaffected by faulting
elsewhere. One potentially important lithological inhomogeneity are the mylonites of the
Cretaceous White Mountain shear zone [<span 
class="cmti-12">Stockli et al.</span>, 2003]. As a first-order test of
relatively uniform composition, note that all the Pelissier Flats samples of <span

[2000, 2003] yielded abundant apatite. A small but significant part of the canyon is
Paleozoic marble [<span

important.

comparing two (cumulative) distributions is the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot [p. 353 of <span 
class="cmti-12">Rice</span>, 1995].
In a Q-Q plot, the quantiles of one distribution are plotted against those of another. Two
distributions are equal if and only if they plot on the 1:1-line. This is clearly not the case for the
CAD of sample C (gray circles on Figure <a

and 19Ma indicating that it was derived from very low elevations. This very localized
provenance of sample C suggests that sediments in the presently active Marble Creek are
derived from a single rock fall event localized very close to the mouth of the Marble Creek
drainage, at an elevation of at most 500m above the sample location (Figures <a

a composite of the entire alluvial fan, in an attempt to get a more integrated view of the entire

<a 
href="#x1-20022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:landsat --></a>). These samples can be jointly considered, because the time span covered by fan surfaces in
debris flow dominated alluvial fans of the Owens Valley is relatively short (<span

class="cmti-12">D</span><span

<span

divided into a coarse (5 cm <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003E; </span>clasts <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003E; </span>7.925 mm) and a fine (2.794 mm <span

fraction. Then, the samples from each of the two groups were mixed and dated with the
AFT method. The resulting CADs are shown as white squares and black circles on
Figure <a 
href="#x1-90026">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:obsCADs --></a>. Most apatites in the composite sample are older than sample C. The coarse
fraction appears to be slightly younger than the fine fraction, but the difference is not
statistically significant (compare the distance between the two CADs with the width
of the gray confidence band in Figure <a 
href="#x1-90026">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:obsCADs --></a>), and we may conclude that grain-size effects
are not very important. Just as we did for sample C, we compare the observed and
predicted CADs for sample D by plotting them on a Q-Q plot (Figure <a 
href="#x1-100017">7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:QQplot --></a>). This analysis
indicates that the composite sample was derived from the entire drainage. Most of the

be well over 100 Ma old, apparently contradicting the 10-55 Ma age range predicted by the
PAZ-curve of <span 
class="cmti-12">Stockli et al. </span>[2000]. At first glance, this observation seems to suggest that some
apatites are derived from outside the Marble Creek catchment. There are at least two possible
sources for such &#8220;contamination&#8221;: (1) the catchment is down wind from the Long Valley
caldera, and the area was likely covered by a thick layer of Bishop volcanic ash; and
(2) eolian processes in the arid Owens Valley might contaminate the Marble Creek
alluvial fan with modern dust. The first possibility can be ruled out because the relatively
coarse grain-size of sample D allowed verification of its granite and marble composition.
Virtually no tuff was found. The coarse grain-size of sample D also drastically reduces the
probability of modern eolian contamination. Alternatively, the &#8220;anomalous&#8221; AFT ages
can be much more easily explained by the counting statistics discussed in Section <a

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-110003.3"></a>Suggestions for future improvements</h4>
<!--l. 768--><p class="noindent" >The CAD method would gain considerable power if the AFT data were complemented by
(U-Th)/He measurements as was done by <span 
class="cmti-12">Stock et al. </span>[2007] for two catchments in the Sierra
Nevada. Whereas the AFT CAD serves as a proxy for the PAZ curve, the (U-Th)/He CAD
would be a proxy for the Partial Retention Zone (PRZ) curve. Because (U-Th)/He
ages from the northern White Mountains have already been measured [<span 
class="cmti-12">Stockli et al.</span>,

2000], this would be relatively easy to do. Measurement uncertainities of single grain
(U-Th)/He measurements are approximately normally distributed, and typically much smaller
than single grain AFT measurement uncertainties. Unfortunately, this is only true for
inclusion-free apatites. The vast majority of igneous apatites contain abundant <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x03B1;</span>-emitting
mineral inclusions such as zircon and monazite, and the Pelissier Flats apatites are
no exception to this. In basement studies, inclusion-free apatites are carefully selected
under a binocular microscope. Not only would doing this for <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">~</span>100 detrital grains be
very time consuming, it would create potentially biased samples. Therefore, detrital
(U-Th)/He studies should also consider inclusion-bearing grains [<span 
class="cmti-12">Vermeesch et al.</span>, 2007].
<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 789--><p class="indent" >   Another approach to obtain more and better information from the AFT data is by
artificially increasing the number of confined fission tracks through heavy-ion irradiation or
exposure to <sup><span 
class="cmr-8">252</span></sup>Cf [e.g., <span 
class="cmti-12">Ohira et al.</span>, 1994]. Like the AFT ages, fission track lengths show
a dependence on paleodepth (and thus elevation). At low and high paleodepths well
above or below the paleo-PAZ, fission tracks are long, whereas in the PAZ, short tracks
also exist. Each AFT age on Figure <a 
href="#x1-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:whitePAZ --></a>.a corresponds to a characteristic distribution of
horizontally confined fission track (HCFT) lengths. Heavy ion irradiation or bombardment by
<sup><span 
class="cmr-8">252</span></sup>Cf fission fragments provides pathways through which the etching acid can reach
more HCFTs, up to a point where there is more than one HCFT per apatite grain,
even for samples with low numbers of spontaneous fission tracks [<span 
class="cmti-12">Ohira et al.</span>, 1994]. If
the HCFT lengths and AFT ages of the same grains are measured, the provenance
paleodepth distribution can be determined more reliably than by only using the AFT
ages. The Marble Creek catchment would be the perfect test-case for this technique,
because the HCFT-length distribution of the basement is known [<span 
class="cmti-12">Stockli et al.</span>, 2000,
2003].
<!--l. 809--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-120004"></a>Conclusions</h3>
<!--l. 811--><p class="noindent" >Apparent ages of low temperature thermochronometers generally decrease with depth below the
surface. When basement terranes are uplifted, this variation produces an age-elevation dependence.
Therefore, it may be possible to recover the provenance elevation of the erosional products of
exhumed fault-blocks. This paper introduced the Cumulative Age Distribution as a tool for
comparing observed detrital age distributions with hypsometric predictions. The CAD is the
cumulative density function of the measured ages. Arguably the most important advantage of the
CAD over alternative approaches is that it visualizes the detrital sample without the need for data
smoothing. (Unequal) measurement uncertainties are incorporated in a hypsometrically
predicted CAD by numerically simulating the sampling process. The statistical variability
caused by the combined effects of limited sample size and analytical uncertainty can
be estimated and visualized with a bootstrapped confidence interval of the predicted
CAD.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 827--><p class="indent" >   If (1) apatite concentration is uniform across the entire drainage basin, (2) measurement
uncertainties are small, and (3) erosion is uniform across the entire drainage basin, then a
hypsometrically weighted CAD of detrital AFT data has the same shape as the PAZ curve of the
basement. Under the aforementioned assumptions, it would be possible to use the CAD as a tool
for paleo-relief reconstruction, by studying sequential CADs through time, where the modern CAD
is used to calibrate the older ones (i.e., convert cumulative percentages to meters), thus taking the
approach suggested by <span 
class="cmti-12">Stock and Montgomery </span>[1996] one step further. Unfortunately,
very few if any field areas fulfill all three requirements. If assumption (3) is not valid,
the method is still useful, because testing assumption (3) yields useful quantitative
geomophological information. The CADs of the White Mountains reveal that sediments in the
currently active Marble Creek are derived from a single point source, but composite
samples of the entire alluvial fan are derived from the whole catchment, with the largest
contributions from the base of the range and lower contributions from higher up the drainage.
