<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >Cambrian sandstones in southern Israel are characteristic of a widespread platform sedimentary cover overlying the
Precambrian basement of North Africa and Arabia. Much of the area that formerly constituted the northern margin
of Gondwana was shaped by metamorphism, deformation and igneous activity during the Neoproterozoic
Pan-African orogeny (Stern, 1994, and references therein). The assembly of the Gondwana supercontinent during
the Neoproterozoic to Early Palaeozoic was the consequence of a prolonged history of orogenic amalgamation
involving continental fragments from eastern and western Gondwana (e.g., Stern, 1994; Shackleton, 1996; Meert,
2003; Condie, 2003; Collins and Pisarevsky, 2005). The East African Orogen (EAO) extends from the
Arabian-Nubian Shield, along the northern sector into East Antarctica (Stern, 1994; Jacobs et al., 2004) (Figure <a 
href="#x1-170011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:map1 --></a>).
It was recently understood that amalgamation of Gondwana occurred during two major periods of orogeny (Meert,

2003; Collins and Pisarevsky, 2005): the pre-600 Ma East African Orogeny and the subsequent 570-500 Ma
Kuunga-Malagasy Orogeny. The latter was mainly documented in eastern Madagascar (Collins and Pisarevsky,
2005) as well as in southeast Kenya (Hauzenberger et al., 2007) and eastern Tanzania (Rossetti et al.,
2008). Deposition of the Cambrian cover sandstone heralds erosion of the Pan-African orogen and the
cratonisation of Neoproterozoic mobile belts (Avigad et al., 2003). Platform sedimentation in north
Gondwana lasted nearly 500 million years (Alsharhan and Nairn, 1997) but was punctuated by long
wavelength vertical motion and a number of unconformities, by Triassic-Jurassic foundering of the
Eastern-Mediterranean basin (Garfunkel and Derin, 1985), and by Tertiary break-up along the Red Sea - Dead Sea
fault system.
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >   During the early Paleozoic, Israel was located near the northern edge of Gondwana at the northern tip of the
Arabian-Nubian Shield. The Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) of North Africa and Arabia is a collage of accreted
Neoproterozoic island arcs squeezed between east and west Gondwana fragments around 630 Ma (Katz et al., 2004;
Johnson and Woldehaimanot, 2003). Current exposure of the northern ANS is dominated by widespread late to
post-orogenic batholiths intruded at 630-600 Ma (Bentor, 1985 and references therein). Calc-alkaline magmatism
was followed by a major phase of erosion, extension and alkaline igneous activity at around 600-580 Ma (Garfunkel,
1999; Beyth et al., 1994). Various Rb/Sr and K-Ar studies have suggested that igneous activity may
have lasted until 540 Ma (Bentor, 1985; Ibrahim and McCourt, 1995; Garfunkel, 1999; Beyth and
Heimann, 1999) but this has not been verified by U-Pb zircon geochronology. The youngest U-Pb
zircon age in the northern ANS is ca. 580Ma (Meert, 2003). By Middle Cambrian time, the northern
part of the ANS (including southern Israel) was eroded to sea level and the exhumed basement was
subjected to intense weathering. In a world without land plants and under acidic atmospheric conditions,
physical and chemical weathering attacked the freshly exhumed basement, and a system of braided rivers
deposited vast sheets of Cambro-Ordovician &#8216;Nubian sandstone&#8217; (Weissbrod, 1980; Weissbrod and
Nachmias, 1986; Avigad et al., 2005). The weathered basement was progressively blanketed (from
north to south; e.g. Garfunkel, 1999) and the entire ANS as far south as Ethiopia and Yemen was
covered by a siliciclastic veneer by Ordovician time (Garfunkel, 2002; Kolodner et al., 2006). Continuous
sedimentation in the Levant continued until Late Devonian time, when the sedimentary cover reached a
thickness of <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>2.5 km (Garfunkel and Derin, 1985; Gvirtzman and Weissbrod, 1985; Segev et al., 1995).
Hercynian doming interrupted Paleozoic sedimentation, and a regional unconformity marks the base of the
Carboniferous (Gvirtzman and Weissbrod, 1985). The area was later affected by the Triassic to Early
Jurassic opening of the Eastern Mediterranean basin (Garfunkel and Derin, 1985). Thick wedges of
predominantly marine sediments, including substantial amounts of carbonate, were deposited on the subsiding
passive margin until the Late Cretaceous, when tectonism affected the northern and eastern margins
of the ANS (Garfunkel and Derin, 1985). Miocene-Oligocene opening of the Red Sea was initially
accommodated by rifting in the Gulf of Suez, but at 4-5 Ma, plate motion shifted to the left-lateral Dead Sea
transform fault (Bartov et al., 1980). Approximately 105 km of strike-slip motion (Quennell, 1958)
formed several pull-apart basins, of which the Dead Sea is the largest (Garfunkel and Ben-Avraham,
1996). We applied low-temperature thermochronology to platform detritus from southern Israel to learn
about events that affected the lithosphere before and after their deposition in the Cambrian. Our
results illuminate the final stages of Neoproterozoic to Cambrian Pan-African orogeny in this region
and help to monitor the long-term post-depositional thermal evolution of the siliciclastic platform
deposits.

<!--l. 185--><p class="noindent" >Cambrian strata in southern Israel near Eilat overlie the Neoproterozoic basement of the ANS (Weissbrod 1980;
Weissbrod and Nachmias, 1986), which was exposed in the Gulf of Eilat and Sinai in the Tertiary as a
result of breakup and rifting along the Red Sea. The Cambrian section at Eilat can be correlated with
similar sections across the Dead Sea rift in Jordan, which in turn can be linked to exposures farther

east and southeast in Saudi Arabia (e.g. the lower part of the Saq Formation; Powers et al., 1966).
At Eilat, the 300m Cambrian section gradually changes upward from subarkose to mature quartz
arenite (Figure <a 
href="#x1-170022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:stratsection --></a>). Fluvial deposits are common at the base, shallow marine sandstones dominate the
remainder and shale and carbonate are present locally. From base to top, the Cambrian sequence in Eilat
area includes (Weissbrod, 1980; Segev, 1984; Garfunkel, 2002): the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Amudei Shelomo Formation</span>, made
of relatively immature arkose and subarkose overlying deeply weathered Neoproterozoic basement.
A basal polymictic conglomerate is often present; the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Timna Formation</span>, made of mainly subarkose
with local carbonate facies. Scarce Trilobites in the carbonates (Parnes, 1971) indicate that these
rocks and the overlying parts of the section are younger than 520 Ma (e.g., Landing et al., 1998); the
<span 
class="ecti-1000">Shehoret Formation</span>, consisting of fine- to coarse grained subarkose; the <span

of Late Cambrian fine-grained quartz arenite with alternating layers of siltstone and claystone; and
the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Amir Formation</span>, made of Lower Cretaceous sandstones unconformibly overlying the Cambrian
section.
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 211--><p class="indent" >   The general trend of increasing sediment maturity is common to the Cambrian section of southern Israel and
sections in Jordan, the Sinai, and northern Saudi Arabia (Weissbrod and Nachmias, 1986; Avigad et al., 2005;
Kolodner et al., 2006), but the depositional gap represented by the unconformity below the Amir Formation
varies. In the subsurface north of Eilat the Cambrian is overlain by Late Carboniferous to Permian
sandstones, whereas in southwestern Sinai, the Cambrian is overlain by Carboniferous sediments (Weissbrod
1980; Garfunkel 2002). A more complete lower Paleozoic section is preserved in Jordan and northern
Saudi Arabia, where continuous sedimentation occured from Cambrian to Devonian time (Figure 2 of
Weissbrod and Nachmias, 1986, and references therein). These geologic constraints are important to the
interpretation of the data presented later. Deposition of Late-Middle to Late Cambrian sandstone
marks the end of the Pan-African orogeny in the region and the onset of platform sedimentation.
Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology (Avigad et al., 2003; Avigad et al. 2005; Kolodner et al., 2006)
revealed that the Cambro-Ordovician sandstones reflect the crustal composition of broad segments of the
ANS and beyond it (Kolodner et al., 2006). The Cambro-Ordovician sandstones on the entire North
Gondwana margin are mineralogically and often texturally mature (Avigad et al., 2005 and references
therein), indicating significant chemical and physical weathering and long-distance transport. The
provenance area of the Cambro-Ordovician sandstone was very large, and detritus was transported
for hundreds and possibly thousands of kilometers. The Cambro-Ordovician sandstones are thus an
excellent monitor of continental-scale geological processes at an important time in Earth history. This
study extends the perspectives gained from U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology by applying a suite
of thermochronometric techniques to detritus from a fine-grained sub-arkose sample of the Shehoret
Formation deposited at <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>500 Ma. We present and discuss new detrital K-feldspar <sup><span

and apatite fission track ages and apatite (U-Th)/He ages. Taken together, our new data reveal a
lengthy and more detailed picture of the pre- and post-depositional thermal history of the Nubian
Sandstone.

Kolodner et al. (2006) for which detrital zircon U-Pb ages are available (Figure <a

weakly consolidated, it was gently crushed by mortar and pestle, thus reducing the potential for damage to
apatite grains. After soaking in 10% acetic acid and 3% hydrogen peroxide until reactions ceased,
magnetic separation was done by vertical and slope Frantz. The nonmagnetic fraction was placed in
lithium metatungstate with a density of 2.96 g/cm<sup><span

and 3.3 g/cm<sup><span

sanidine with an assumed age of 28.34 <span

was unwrapped and 50 single grains were placed in a crucible under high vacuum for laser analysis at Stanford
University. Apparent ages of single grains were measured by total fusion with an Ar-ion laser. The second aliquot
was analyzed by step-wise heating in a double-vacuum resistance furnace. For both aliquots the gettered gas was
analyzed in a high sensitivity MAP 216 noble-gas mass spectrometer with Baur-Signer ion source (Baur,
1980).

<!--l. 278--><p class="indent" >   Zircon fission track ages were measured by Paul O&#8217;Sullivan of Apatite to Zircon, Inc. using the external detector
method (Hurford and Green, 1983). Fish Canyon Tuff zircon was used as an irradiation standard. Apatites were
mounted in epoxy, ground, and polished. The mounts were etched for 15 s in 23% HNO<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">3</span></sub> at 25 <sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2218;</span></sup>C (Jonckheere et al.,
2007). They were then covered with muscovite external detectors, and irradiated at the Garching/Munich reactor.
The muscovite external detectors were etched in 40% HF for 30 minutes at room temperature. Two mounts of Fish
Canyon apatite and three shards of Durango apatite standards were irradiated together with the sample along
with mm-sized shards of standard uranium glass. Track counting was performed at ETH Z&uuml;rich, on
c-axis parallel apatite surfaces under 1250<span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x00D7; </span>magnification. The muscovite external detectors were
repositioned trackside down on the apatite mounts in the same position as during irradiation. Fossil tracks
were counted by focusing on the apatite surface through the muscovite detector; induced tracks were
counted by focusing on the underside of the external detector without moving the microscope stage
(Jonckheere et al., 2003). Chlorine content was used as the kinetic parameter, and measured a Jeol 8100
Superprobe (WDS) at Birkbeck, University of London. Analysis was carried out using an accelerating
voltage of 15 kV, current of 2.5 nA and a beam diameter of 1 <span

<!--l. 331--><p class="noindent" >The detrital zircon age spectrum from sample K-5 resembles that of other samples of Cambrian and Ordovician
sandstones in Israel and Jordan (Kolodner et al., 2006), providing an image of the pre-depositional history of the

source terrane (Figure <a 
href="#x1-170044">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:logplots --></a>a). Thirty-four of 55 zircons are of Neoproterozoic Pan-African provenance between 900 and
530 Ma. The U-Pb detrital zircon age spectrum generally overlaps with the history of igneous activity in the ANS
that lasted for nearly 300 m.y. spanning much of the Neoproterozoic (Stern, 1994). While the pre-Neoproterozoic
zircons have been interpreted as far-traveled, it is possible that some are recycled inherited grains derived from more
proximal Neoproterozoic rocks (Avigad et al., 2003; Hargrove et al., 2006). The precise origin of Late Neoproterozoic
to Cambrian age (570-530) detrital zircons is also not known as potential source rocks displaying U-Pb zircon
ages of this type are uncommon in the northern ANS (Meert 2003). Such rocks are more common in
the southern half of the EAO (Kuster and Harms, 1998). All these are plausible sources because the
textural and mineralogical maturity of the sandstone evince significant transport. Five grains are actually
younger than the inferred 500 Ma depositional age of the Shehoret Formation, and three of these five are
concordant. We are confident that these anomalously young ages are not a result of sample contamination
because the four samples studied by Kolodner et al. (2006) from the Shehoret area contained a similar
proportion of anomalously young grains. Later in this paper we will propose an authigenic origin for these
zircons.

<!--l. 359--><p class="noindent" >Two sets of <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar data were collected from sample K-6. Fifty single-grain K-feldspar laser total fusion
extractions yielded a population of ages that tightly cluster around 535 Ma (Cambrian), indicating a single
provenance and thermal history. About half of these grains yield apparent ages that are younger than the zircon
U-Pb age spectrum, whereas the other half overlap with the very latest phase of igneous activity as recorded in the
zircon U-Pb age spectra. Nearly all K-feldspar grains are older than the depositional age, although some by only a
few million years (Figure <a 
href="#x1-170044">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:logplots --></a>b). A similar picture emerges from the step-heating experiment (Figure <a 
href="#x1-170055">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:plateau --></a>).
Except for the first few temperature steps that amount to less than 10% of the <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar released, the
spectrum yields late Neoproterozoic to Cambrian apparent ages between 520 and 580 Ma. Because
it is possible that even the high temperature part of the age spectrum is affected by hydrothermal
alteration, these should be considered minimum ages. The Arrhenius diagram shows multi diffusion-domain
behavior typical of K-feldspars (Figure <a 
href="#x1-170055">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:plateau --></a>). The short time lag between the <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar ages and the
depositional age of the sandstone suggests that these grains cooled rapidly, an observation that is
corroborated by the step-heating experiment. Because K-feldspars cannot be characterized by a single
diffusion domain, they rarely feature easily interpretable age spectra, especially if they experienced a
slow and complex thermal history (Lovera et al., 1989). Alternatively, the &#8216;kink&#8217; in the Arrhenius
diagram could also be an artifact of multiple stages of crystal growth (Villa, 2006). In this context, the
relatively flat age spectrum of K-6 can be taken as evidence for the simple, rapid, and quasi-simultaneous
cooling and/or crystallization of all the K-feldspar grains contained in it. The flat appearance of the age
spectrum also lends credibility to the single step total-fusion ages of the detrital K-feldspar grains
(Lovera et al., 1999). The &#8216;partial retention zone&#8217; of the <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar system in K-feldspar is between
200-400<sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2218;</span></sup>C for cooling rates greater than 5<sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2218;</span></sup>C/Ma (Lovera et al., 1993). Because all the detrital K-feldspars
and nearly the entire <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar age spectrum are older than the depositional age, the sample was
probably not heated to more than 200<sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2218;</span></sup>C after deposition, nor did it undergo complete re-crystallization.
Because the sample was a composite collection of unreset detrital grains, we did not attempt to extract
a continuous time-temperature model from the data by inverse modeling (Lovera, 1989). Different
grains within the sample went through different high-temperature histories, but shared a common
low-temperature history. Therefore, the low-temperature part of the step-heating experiment might contain a
post-depositional reheating signal, an idea that will be discussed in the following section. The flat
section of the age spectrum represents an averaged high temperature age signal of all the component
grains. Thus, the average K-feldspar grain in our sample passed through the 300<sup><span

Ma.

richer in uranium than their rounded cores (Figure <a

that of the ZFT ages (Figure <a 
href="#x1-170044">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:logplots --></a>d) because of the lower number of tracks in the apatite. There are fewer induced
tracks because the sample was somewhat under-irradiated (we did not expect to find such old ages), and there are
fewer spontaneous tracks because apatite generally has a lower uranium concentration than zircon. The AFT
ages approximately follow a lognormal distribution (Figure <a

alpha-ejection correction, which assumes a uniform chemical composition. As noted above, a substantial number of
the apatites in sample K-6 are compositionally zoned (Figure <a

<!--l. 466--><p class="noindent" >Unreset detrital K-feldspar <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar ages are generally interpreted either as representing cooling or crystallization
of the source terrane. Igneous evolution in the ANS is thought to have outlasted the latest Neoproterozoic. Many
have reported Rb-Sr, K-Ar and <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar ages in the range of 560-530 Ma and some of these results were
interpreted to reflect crystallization (Ibrahim and McCourt, 1995; Beyth et al., 1994, 1999). In particular, it is
commonly thought (e.g., Bentor 1985) that post-orogenic and/or extension-related alkaline igneous activity (as well

as several diking phases and various volcanics) occurred between 600-540 Ma (at least in the northern ANS). Our
literature survey failed to reveal zircon U-Pb ages in support of this; the youngest published zircon age we found is
<span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>580 Ma (Jarrar et al., 1991, 1993; see also summary of ANS geochronological data by Meert, 2003). An
extensive summary of available geochronological data provided by Meert (2003) reveals that U-Pb zircon
crystallization ages younger than 580Ma are confined to the Kuunga-Malagasy Orogen which flanks the
Arabian-Nubian Shield in the SE at a distance of some 2000 km from Eilat. Avigad et al. (2003) and
Kolodner et al. (2006) demonstrated the presence of far-traveled pre-Neoproterozoic detrital zircons
in Eilat and it is plausible that the ca. 550 Ma detrital zircons in this area are sourced from such
a distal provenance. However, it is unlikely that the detrital K-feldspar in the Shehoret Formation
has a similarly distal provenance. With respect to Eilat, a mid to short range provenance within the
Arabian-Nubian Shield is the most likely source for these feldspars. Moreover, although some alkaline
rocks in southern Israel yielded Rb/Sr ages of ca <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>530 Ma, U-Pb dating of an alkaline granite from a
nearby outcrop yielded <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>610 Ma (Beyth et al., 1994). Thus, the interpretation of the 530-560 Ma
Rb/Sr and <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar ages in terms of crystallization is questionable. Similar ages in the range of
530-540 Ma were reported from many basement rocks of the ANS and were shown to reflect widespread
thermal resetting at the end of the Pan-African orogeny. Resetting of the K-Ar and Rb-Sr systems at
around 530 Ma in older basement rocks has been reported from the Sinai peninsula (e.g., Ayalon et
al., 1987; Bielski et al., 1979), Jordan, Israel and other parts of the ANS (for example Fleck et al.,
1976) and is one of the most fundamental features of the so called &#8217;Pan-African orogeny&#8217; of Kennedy
(1964).
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 505--><p class="indent" >   It is certainly possible that our K-feldspar <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar have been affected by subsequent (hydro)thermal activity
and are, therefore, minimum ages. However, in light of the regionally abundant 560-530 Ma cooling
ages discussed in the previous paragraph, we should also consider the alternative possibility that our
<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar-ages are &#8216;real&#8217;. We will make this assumption for the remainer of this section. Because none of the
basement rocks exposed in Israel, Jordan and Sinai yielded zircon U-Pb ages younger than 580 Ma it is
difficult to interpret the K-feldspar ages as crystallization ages. Only the oldest ages in the detrital age
spectra could potentially reflect crystallization because they overlap with known crystallization ages
defined by U-Pb zircon data. It is more likely that many of the detrital K-feldspars were derived from
rocks that were affected by the widespread thermal resetting at the end of Pan-African orogeny. We
suggest that insights as to how ANS basement rocks were reset can be obtained from the petrographical
observations of sandstone sample K-6. The detritus in this sample is a mixture of sub-rounded and angular
grains reflecting mixing between proximal and more distal provenance. Microcline is the most abundant
feldspar in sample K-6. Plagioclase and perthite are practically absent, a feature which is suggestive
of elimination of the less resistant minerals by weathering. Furthermore, the exclusive presence of
microcline in the sample we dated may be a clue to the geodynamic significance of the Pan-African
resetting.
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 530--><p class="indent" >   The Pan-African orogeny in the ANS culminated in the intrusion of massive calc-alkaline granitoid batholiths
(630-600 Ma; Bentor, 1985; Beyth et al., 1994; Garfunkel 1999) which currently make up more than 60% of ANS
exposure (Stern and Hedge, 1985). Emplacement of these batholiths was immediately followed by intrusion of
shallow alkaline granitoids and dike swarms. Petrological observations indicate that the calc-alkaline phase is
dominated by subsolvus granitoids featuring Na-rich plagioclase and microcline as individual phases
indicating consolidation at significant depth (Garfunkel, 1999). In contrast, the alkaline rocks are shallow
level intrusions and their mineralogy is often (but not exclusively) dominated by perthite. Because
perthite is practically absent from sample K-6, and because calc-alkaline granitoids are by far more
abundant, many (if not all) of our <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar-dated feldspars were probably derived from the calc-alkaline
batholiths. A large body of evidence suggests that calc-alkaline rocks were first exposed by about 600 Ma.
Neoproterozoic molasse basins formed in the northern ANS immediately following the calc-alkaline
batholitic stage. They are well known in Jordan (Saramuj; Jarrar et al., 1993), the Eastern Desert
of Egypt (Hammamat; Willis et al., 1988) and in the subsurface of Israel (Zenifim; Weissbrod and

Sneh, 2002). They contain immature detritus and conglomerates derived from exposed calc-alkaline
granitoids and older basement rocks, and are frequently interbedded with volcanics. The deposition of the
Hammamat and hence exhumation of the underlying basement including the abundant calc-alkaline
batholiths is constrained by the intrusion of a <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>585 Ma perthitic biotite-granite into the sediments
(Willis et al., 1988) and by the presence of 600-580 Ma andesites and rhyolites (Dokhan volcanics)
interbedded in this unit (Stern and Hedge, 1985). In southern Jordan, the Saramuj Formation is a
thick conglomerate unit derived from the underlying basement (Jarrar et al., 1991) and pierced by a
<span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>590 Ma monzogranite (Jarrar et al., 1993). Thus, field relations and geochronology indicate that the
molasse basins were established upon, and fed from, eroded calc-alkaline batholiths whose ages are no
younger than <span

<!--l. 595--><p class="noindent" >The ZFT partial annealing zone is 175 - 250<sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2218;</span></sup>C depending on the thermal history (Brandon et al., 1998). Our ZFT
ages cluster at 380 Ma, about 100 m.y. younger than the K-feldspar ages and indicating that the Cambrian
sandstone section in southern Israel was heated to temperatures corresponding to low-grade metamorphism
subsequent to deposition. Although the ZFT data fail the <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03C7;</span><sup><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sup>-test (P(<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03C7;</span><sup><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sup>) = 2%), the fact that all zircon grains are
younger than the depositional age, and the remarkable coincidence between the ZFT ages and authigenic clays in
the same deposits (discussed later) indicates that the ZFT system is almost, if not completely, reset.
The fact that the former are thermally reset whereas the latter are not implies that the low-grade
metamorphism that affected the Cambrian sandstone during Devonian time did not reach temperatures high
enough to completely reset the <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar clock of the detrital K-feldspars. It may seem odd that
the ZFT thermochronometer is completely reset by a thermal pulse that has an only minor effect on
the K-feldspar <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar system. However, the effective closure temperature of the ZFT system is
controversial and has been demonstrated to be sensitive to a range of factors, including cooling rate
and radiation damage (Brandon et al., 1998; Rahn et al., 2004). Although the combination of these
parameters remains poorly understood, the argon and ZFT data nevertheless put tight constraints (within a
few tens of degrees) on the post-depositional thermal history of the Shehoret Formation. While we
did not attempt to inverse-model the argon release spectrum for the reasons outlined above, we did
forward-model a thermal history in which rapid cooling at 560 Ma is followed by a 1 m.y. heating spike
to 200<sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2218;</span></sup>C at 380 Ma (Figure <a 
href="#x1-170055">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:plateau --></a>). Despite its simplicity (only two diffusion domains were employed)
the model adequately replicates the low-temperature part of the <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar age spectrum (Figure <a 
href="#x1-170055">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:plateau --></a>).

Although this model is far from unique (the intensity of the heating peak, for example, could be higher if
its duration were shorter), it does illustrate that a single heating pulse could be responsible for the
partial loss of radiogenic argon from the least retentive parts of the K-feldspars, while leaving the
more retentive zones, which are probed by the high temperature steps of the release spectrum, largely
unaffected.
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 633--><p class="indent" >   The late Devonian ZFT ages are entirely compatible with the regional geologic context. By itself, the erosional
unconformity between the late Cambrian Netafim Formation and the early Cretaceous Amir Formation in
southern Israel is not very informative. Tighter constraints are possible if we assume that the northern
ANS behaved as a single block and that stratigraphic sections of southern Israel, the Sinai, southern
Jordan and northwestern Saudi Arabia can be reliably correlated (Weissbrod and Nachmias, 1986). In
the southwestern Sinai, the Netafim is Early Carboniferous, not Cretaceous, and northwestern Saudi
Arabia shows a continuous stratigraphic section from the Cambrian until the Devonian (Figure 2 of
Weissbrod and Nachmias, 1986). Jointly considered, these observations imply that major erosion occurred
at or near the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary, when deepest burial also occurred (Segev et al.,
1995).
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 649--><p class="indent" >   These conclusions agree with an earlier ZFT study from boreholes in Sinai and southern Israel (Kohn et al.,
1992) and basement rocks in the Eastern Desert of Egypt (Bojar et al., 2002). ZFT ages for the Precambrian
basement and infra-Cambrian sediments in the subsurface of Israel (Zenifim Formation) are within the range
328-373Ma, consistent with our results for the Shehoret Formation. Although the lower Paleozoic of southern Israel
is less than 300 m thick, Kohn et al. (1992) inferred that the basement must have been covered by a thick
sedimentary cover that was rapidly removed during an important late Devonian - early Carboniferous tectonic event.
Their inference was based on their thermochronometric data and the same regional stratigraphic considerations
summarized in the previous paragraph. In addition to counting zircon fission tracks, Kohn et al. (1992) analyzed
sphene and found it to be only partially reset. The annealing temperature of sphene is slightly higher
than zircon, and thus Kohn et al. (1992) constrained the maximum temperature attained during the
Devonian-Carboniferous event to <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>225<sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2218;</span></sup>C. This is in agreement with our thermochronological findings based
on the paired <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar-ZFT results (see above). Kohn et al. (1992, see also Summer et al., 1995)
obtained similar Devonian ZFT ages from Permo-Triassic sandstones and they concluded that these
are recycled earlier Paleozoic sandstone, predicting that the Cambrian of southern Israel should also
have been thermally reset by a 370 Ma event. Our data provide the first direct confirmation of their
prediction.
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 675--><p class="indent" >   The impact of a Devonian thermal event is imprinted in several other mineralogical systems too. Rb-Sr ages of <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x003C;</span>
2<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03BC;</span>m clays within shales and dolostones of the Early Cambrian Timna Formation are identical (365-381 Ma) to the
ZFT data, as are K-Ar and Rb-Sr ages of the insoluble residue of manganese nodules that are found in the same
formation (Segev et al., 1995). Identical ages were obtained by Harlavan (1992) on clay minerals from
the Cambrian section in Israel using <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar geochronology, and Heimann et al. (1995) obtained
<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar ages of <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>378 Ma on altered biotites separated from schistose dikes of the Eilat basement and
suggested they reflect the influence of a Devonian hydrothermal system. The apatites in the Shehoret
Formation give further morphological evidence for a Late Devonian (hydro)thermal event. The cores of the
detrital apatites are extremely rounded (Figures <a 
href="#x1-170066">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:AFTpix --></a> - <a 
href="#x1-170077">7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:alpha --></a>), suggestive of long transport. The authigenic
overgrowths of some grains are euhedral and are therefore post-depositional. No authigenic apatites
have been reported in deposits younger than Devonian (Weissbrod and Nachmias, 1986). While it
has been postulated that abundant U-mineralization observed in the Cambrian of southern Israel
occurred during the Neogene (Segev, 1992), our observations imply that a pulse of authigenic apatite
growth from a uranium-rich fluid phase occurred during the late Devonian in conjunction with the
thermal event recorded by the ZFT. The maximum thickness of the sedimentary cover that overlies the
Cambrian of Israel during Devonian time can be estimated by correlation with Jordan where it is <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>2.5
km thick. It is unlikely that the thermal event recorded by the ZFT was uniquely a consequence of

burial, because the overburden was too thin to permit temperatures in the range of 200<sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2218;</span></sup>C at its base.
We suggest that the thermal event resulted from hydrothermal fluid circulation related to low-grade
anchimetamorphic phenomena that caused the abundant recrystallization of clay minerals and mobilised
U.
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 708--><p class="indent" >   As discussed above, Kolodner et al. (2006) reported a small but significant fraction of concordant
post-depositional zircon U/Pb ages from the Cambrian section of southern Israel. No such grains were
found in the Jordanian sections, which were located 50km east of our sample (and 100km south of it,
prior to the onset of left-lateral slip on the Dead Sea transform fault). The anomalously young grains
are characterized by relatively high U concentrations (Kolodner et al., 2006) and were interpreted
as metamict. In view of the U mineralization and the development of U-rich rims around apatites
it is possible that some detrital zircons might have experienced an authigenic overgrowth. Similar
observations of authigenic zircon growth have been made elsewhere (Saxena, 1966; Dempster et al., 2004)
.
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 722--><p class="indent" >   Like the zircons, also the apatites were completely reset after deposition. The <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>270 Ma AFT ages are
systematically younger than the ZFT ages by about <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>100 m.y. (Figures <a

href="#x1-170088">8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:radial --></a>). Together with the large spread of
the AFT ages, this suggests an extended and/or repeated residence in the AFT Partial Annealing Zone (PAZ: 60 -
110<sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2218;</span></sup>C; Brandon et al., 1998). The unconformity at the base of the Early Cretaceous sandstones that immediately
overlie the Cambrian in southern Israel (Figure <a 
href="#x1-170033">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:map2 --></a>), is not recorded in the AFT data, implying that probably less
than 2 km of sedimentary cover had been eroded by then. As explained previously, the Late Cambrian Netafim
Formation in the southwestern Sinai is overlain by Carboniferous deposits. Therefore, there have been at least two
episodes of surface exposure of lower Paleozoic rocks in this area. The AFT ages and track length distribution
therefore probably record a complex history with several stages of burial and erosion in and out of the
PAZ. In Elat area (at the surface) the entire Phaneorozoic section (i.e. Cambrian and then Lower
Cretaceous to Eocene) is about 1.0-1.2 km thick (Figure <a 
href="#x1-170033">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:map2 --></a>.c), which is more or less the thickness of
the section that was denuded during the Tertiary (Gvirtzman, 2004). Despite the relatively small
number (44) of horizontally confined fission tracks in our sample, we inverse modeled the thermal history
using the <span 
class="ectt-1000">HeFTy </span>program of Ketcham (2005). Chlorine content was used as the kinetic parameter, and
default values were used for all settings. The search space was very broadly defined in order to allow
non-monotonic thermal histories. A large number of models were found that can explain the data, all of which
indicate a prolonged stay in the upper part of the PAZ (Figure <a 
href="#x1-170099">9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:AFTtT --></a>). The models suggest a late Cretaceous
heating pulse, consistent with the local stratigraphy and with our (U-Th)/He data, which are discussed
next.
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 753--><p class="indent" >   The apatite (U-Th)/He ages range from 33 to 77 Ma. The substantial scatter in these data can be
explained by the extreme compositional zonation associated with the authigenic U-rich overgrowths
on some of the grains. If the overgrowths survived the mineral separation, then the alpha ejection
corrections of these grains are too small and the older (U-Th)/He ages (<span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>70Ma) are more likely to be
accurate. With partial retention zone temperatures of about 55-80<sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2218;</span></sup>C (Farley, 2000), our (U-Th)/He ages
place an upper limit of 1-2 km (depending on the geothermal gradient) on the exhumation of the
Shehoret Formation since the Late Cretaceous. We see no evidence for exposure and denudation related to
Tertiary Red Sea rifting. This is compatible with the current moderate relief in the vicinity of the
Cambrian outcrops near Eilat, on the western side of the Dead Sea transform. Overall, the base of the
sedimentary section in southern Israel and the underlying basement were already close to the surface
by 70 Ma. Assuming that our apparent (U-Th)/He ages are correct, there is a striking coincidence
between them and the apparent heating pulse that clearly stands out from the AFT inverse model
(Figure <a 
href="#x1-1701010">10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:t-T --></a>). Because of the imprecision of the latter, it is not clear whether this really reflects a Late
Cretaceous tectonic pulse (consistent with Garfunkel and Derin, 1985) or if it coincides with the Tertiary
opening of the Red Sea instead. Whatever the underlying cause, the most recent phase in the thermal
evolution of the Eilat area is consistent with a decreasing geothermal gradient, as proposed by Kohn et al.

(1990).

 id="x1-140006"></a>Conclusions </h3>
<!--l. 781--><p class="noindent" >This paper illustrates the utility of applying several geo- and thermochronological techniques to a detrital
sample collected from an ancient platform sequence. Together with stratigraphic and petrographic
observations, our measurements help create a more detailed picture of the 500 million year history of the
Late Cambrian Shehoret Formation of southern Israel. Previous U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology of
these deposits revealed a mixture of sources and highlighted the Precambrian crustal evolution in the
Pan-African provenance, dominated by erosion of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) (Kolodner et al.,
2006).
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 792--><p class="indent" >   Fifty single-grain K-feldspar total fusion argon extractions yielded a population of ages that tightly cluster
around 535 Ma (Cambrian). The <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar age spectrum of a multi-grain K-feldspar aliquot displays
diffusion behaviour compatible with <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x003E;</span>560 Ma cooling later affected by a heating event. Because our
K-feldspar dates are minimum ages, it is certainly possible that the ANS experienced a simple single phase
exhumation history during the Neoproterozoic. It is intriguing, however, that similar 560-530Ma ages have
been reported in the literature before. Although the latter were mostly obtained by the K-Ar and
Rb-Sr methods and may, therefore, not be very robust, we did consider the consequences of a 560-530
Ma event for our field area. Our literature survey failed to retrieve U-Pb zircon ages younger than
580 Ma in the northern ANS. Much of the northern ANS crustal surface is dominated by <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>630 Ma
calcalkaline granites and it would therefore be likely that many of the detrital K-feldspar grains in the
Shehoret formation issued from the erosion of these rocks. Geological evidence (Garfunkel, 1999) indicates
that these granitoids were first exposed by ca. 600 Ma. Therefore a preponderance of the 560-530 Ma
<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar ages we measured may represent reburial and reheating of ANS crustal segments below a
thick volcano-sedimentary pile. The 535-560 Ma ages correspond to Kennedy&#8217;s &#8216;Pan-African event&#8217;
and although further work is required this may be the first time the nature of this event has been
revealed.
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 817--><p class="indent" >   The Cambian-Ordovician sedimentary cover of northern Gondwana was relatively thin (1-3 km thick; Garfunkel
2002; Kolodner et al., 2006) but covered a very large area from present-day Morocco to Oman (Avigad et al., 2003).
The middle Cambrian Shehoret Formation of southern Israel was covered by about 2.5 km of younger sediments by
the middle/late Devonian, more than at any other time (Segev et al., 1995). At <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>380 Ma, a thermo-tectonic
event increased the ambient temperature and heated the Shehoret Formation to <span 
class="cmsy-10">~</span>200<sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2218;</span></sup>C, resetting the
ZFT system but leaving the K-feldspar <sup><span 
class="cmr-7">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">39</span></sup>Ar system relatively unaffected. Uranium-rich fluids
circulated through the sandstone and formed authigenic clays (Segev et al., 1995) and apatite overgrowths
(Weissbrod and Nachmias, 1986), which complicate the alpha-ejection correction applied to our apatite
(U-Th)/He data. After this fluid circulation event, the Shehoret Formation was repeatedly buried and
exhumed in the upper crust (<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x003C;</span>200<sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&#x2218;</span></sup>C), as several regionally important stratigraphic unconformities were
created.
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 835--><p class="indent" >   AFT inverse modeling confirms this theory and hints at a brief Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary heating pulse.
Although this pulse coincides with seven detrital apatite (U-Th)/He ages, those data show substantial scatter
between 33 and 77 Ma, likely resulting from extreme compositional zonation associated with the authigenic U-rich
overgrowths. The 70 Ma (U-Th)/He ages are more likely to be accurate, setting 1-2 km as an upper limit (depending
on the geothermal gradient) on the post-Cretaceous exhumation of the Cambrian sandstone. Our detrital
thermochronology shows no evidence for substantial denudation related to Tertiary rifting of the Red Sea,
compatible with the idea that this part of the plate boundary was dominated by strike-slip motion and its western
side residing at low elevation.
