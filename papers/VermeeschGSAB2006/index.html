<a 
 id="x1-1000doc"></a>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >The topography and geology of central California are dominated by petrotectonic elements of the
Mesozoic convergent margin: the Sierra Nevada magmatic arc, the Great Valley forearc basin, and the
Franciscan accretionary prism. These three domains are genetically linked, inasmuch as they were jointly
formed by Pacific plate subduction beginning in the Late Jurassic (Dickinson <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al.</span>, 1996), until the
transformation of the subduction zone into a transform margin during the Late Cenozoic (Atwater, 1970).
The upper Mesozoic strata of the Great Valley Group (or Sequence: Bailey <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al.</span>, 1964) filled the forearc
basin, and comprise one of the thickest sequences of Cretaceous sediments known (Ingersoll, 1982). These
Great Valley Group strata crop out in a homocline along the western margin of California&#8217;s Central
Valley, and are in fault contact with the Franciscan accretionary complex (Dickinson <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al.</span>,
1996).<br

<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   This paper focuses on samples of the Great Valley Group collected in and around Joaquin Ridge near
Coalinga (Figure <a 
href="#x1-10011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:gvgeology --></a>). These sedimentary rocks contain geochronological and petrographic information
about the evolution of their source region, the Mesozoic Sierra Nevada magmatic arc. They also contain
clues about their post-depositional history, and the tectonic evolution of the Diablo Range in which they
are now exposed. Conventional petrographic studies of Great Valley Group rocks indicate that, with time,
the lithic fraction of the sediments decreased, the percentage of total feldspar increased and the
composition of the feldspars became more potassic. These trends reflect increasing chemical and
geomorphic maturity of the magmatic arc (Ingersoll, 1979, 1983). Paleocurrents are dominantly
west-directed, indicating that the source was the southern Sierra Nevada (Ingersoll, 1979).
In addition to conventional petrographic studies, samples in the vicinity of Coalinga were
studied by bulk-rock <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03F5;</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">Nd</span></sub> and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03F5;</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">Sr</span></sub> analysis (Linn <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al.</span>, 1991, 1992), confirming the petrographic
results. Between Cenomanian and Maastrichtian time, <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03F5;</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">Nd</span></sub> systematically decreased from
-0.7 to -5.0 (Linn <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al.</span>, 1991), reflecting an eastward migration of the drainage divide, to
where the Sierran magmas are more continental in composition (De Paolo, 1981). Some of
the samples of Linn <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al. </span>(1991) were used by DeGraaff-Surpless <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al. </span>(2002) for SHRIMP
single grain zircon U/Pb age measurements, which confirmed that the sediment source for the
Great Valley Group in the San Joaquin Valley is the southern Sierra Nevada, as the most
frequently observed ages are 102-132 Ma. The spread of the Mesozoic ages and the number
of peaks in the grain-age histograms increase with decreasing depositional age. This may
reflect an expansion of fluvial drainage basins, resulting in a larger sediment source area.
The minimum lag-time between the age of zircon crystallization and deposition (determined
by paleontology) is short (3-15 Ma). This constrains the Late Cretaceous exhumation rate
of the Sierra Nevada (Surpless, 2001) &#8211; constraints that this paper will attempt to refine.
<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >   Nevertheless, considerable controversy exists about the exhumation history of the Sierra Nevada
batholith. Some workers, based on the observation of uplifted and tilted Cenozoic strata,
believe that the development of Sierran topography occurred in the last 10 My (e.g., Unruh,
1991). Others claim that significant topography existed since at least the Early Cenozoic
based on old (U-Th)/He cooling ages of the Sierra Nevada granites, and the fact that the
spatial distribution of these ages preserves the signature of old topography (House <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al.</span>, 1998,
2001). Both opinions are based upon data acquired from rocks of the modern Sierra Nevada.
They seldom make use of the continuous record of sediments shed from the ancient mountain
range since the Late Jurassic. These sediments are excellent &#8220;witnesses&#8221; of the evolution of
the Sierra Nevada, for much of the batholith and its volcanic carapace have long since been
removed.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 143--><p class="indent" >   Detritus from the Sierra Nevada was deposited in the Great Valley forearc basin. Above these strata
was deposited a gradually shoaling-upward succession of Cenozoic deposits (Dibblee, 1971; Bartow, 1991).
A total thickness of 6000-8000m of the Upper Jurassic through Cretaceous Great Valley Group is exposed
in a homocline on the eastern flanks of the Diablo Range (Dickinson, 2002). Superimposed on this
homocline are folds formed as a result of right-lateral transpressional strike-slip deformation along the San
Andreas fault (Miller, 1998). The Vallecitos syncline is one of these synclinal folds (Figure <a 
href="#x1-10011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:gvgeology --></a>). Cenozoic
strata contain petroleum, although they are buried less than 1500m deep in the syncline (Rentschler,

1985). The heat source for oil generation is enigmatic. Joaquin Ridge forms the anticline adjacent to the
Vallecitos syncline. The New Idria serpentinite body is exposed in the core of this anticline. A few small
intrusions of syenite crop out in the serpentinite body, and are dated at <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>12.8 Ma (no error
stated) by <sup><span 
class="cmr-8">40</span></sup>Ar/<sup><span 
class="cmr-8">39</span></sup>Ar dating on the amphibole barkevikite (Obradovich <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al.</span>, 2000). Rb-Sr
dating of benitoite yielded an age of <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~ </span>12 Ma (no error stated) (Obradovich <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al.</span>, 2000).
The Mendocino triple junction passed the latitude of New Idria at <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>12-14 Ma (Johnson and
O&#8217;Neill, 1984). <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>14 Ma is also the age of the spectacular deposits of the Big Blue Formation,
which consist almost solely of sedimentary serpentinite (Casey and Dickinson, 1976; Bate,
1985).<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >   In the following sections, new fission track and vitrinite reflectance data are presented, followed by a
discussion of implications of these data. To reconstruct the pre-depositional history of sediments, they
must not be thermally reset. Therefore, the post-depositional history of the New Idria area will be
discussed first. Among other conclusions we demonstrate that, until the rapid exhumation of
the serpentinite dome, this area was characterized by low thermal gradients that prevented
the buried sediments from being heated very much. The discussion of the pre-depositional
history then follows. This paper illustrates the great power of simultaneously using multiple
thermochronometers on detrital sediments. Each individual thermochronometer only tells part of
the story, but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. When all evidence is jointly
considered, a self-consistent story emerges that traces the sediments from their crystallization in the
Cretaceous Sierra Nevada until the final stages of their exhumation on Joaquin Ridge. This
story not only has consequences for the regional geology of the Coalinga/New Idria area, but
also for the tectonic history of the Sierra Nevada and the petroleum geology of the Vallecitos
syncline.

<!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" >Figure 1 shows a simplified geologic map of the field area with indication of the sample locations. Some of
these samples were previously discussed by Linn <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al. </span>(1991, 1992) and DeGraaff-Surpless <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al. </span>(2002).
They are labeled with the letters &#8220;GV&#8221;. An additional six samples were collected along a transect on
Joaquin Ridge and are labeled with the letters &#8220;JR&#8221;. Table <a 
href="#x1-20021">1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:summary --></a> summarizes the geochronological data.
Apatites and zircons were separated from their host rock using the mineral separation techniques reported
by DeGraaff-Surpless <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al. </span>(2002). All samples yielded abundant euhedral apatites and zircons. Both
zircon and apatite fission track ages were measured with the external detector method (e.g.,
Dumitru, 2000). Figure <a 
href="#x1-40012">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:AFTages --></a> shows the apatite fission track data from Joaquin Ridge, arranged
in order of decreasing stratigraphic age. Five of six samples on Joaquin Ridge came from
the Great Valley Group, while the youngest sample (JR6) came from the Middle Miocene
Temblor Formation, beneath the Middle Miocene Big Blue Formation. Figure <a 
href="#x1-40023">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:ZFTages --></a> shows five zircon
fission track samples labeled and arranged in decreasing order of stratigraphic age like the
apatite fission track ages of Figure <a 
href="#x1-40012">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:AFTages --></a>. The dark gray bands on the radial plots of samples
GV21 and GV33 mark the range of crystallization ages measured by U/Pb SHRIMP dating
(DeGraaff-Surpless <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al.</span>, 2002). The light gray bands mark the depositional ages (Dibblee, 1971).
Between n=20 and n=41 grains were dated per fission track sample. The probability p that either
the oldest or the youngest population fraction of size f was missed by all n grains is given
by:

<!--l. 217--><p class="indent" >
   <center class="math-display" >
<img

p = 2(1 - f)  - (1- 2f)
" class="math-display" ></center>
<!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >   For example, if n=30 and f=0.12, then p=5%. In other words, there is 5% chance that
either the youngest or the oldest 12% of the detrital population was missed. In addition to
the aforementioned outcrop samples, we also had access to material from two boreholes on
Joaquin Ridge, the ARCO &#8220;Christie #1&#8221; and ARCO &#8220;Joaquin Ridge #1&#8221; wells. Vitrinite
reflectance measurements were performed on 23 well cutting samples from &#8220;Joaquin Ridge #1&#8221; and
three core samples from &#8220;Christie #1&#8221;. Up to 100 reflected light points were measured on the
vitrinite populations represented in each sample. The lowest reflectance values likely reflect
contamination from organic matter in the drilling fluid, while some of the higher reflectance
values may represent resedimented vitrinite. However, rather than arbitrarily rejecting some
data, we have opted to just contour and plot all the data (Figure <a 
href="#x1-50014">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:vitrinite --></a>). The raw data for both
the fission track and the vitrinite reflectance analysis are available in the Data Repository

<!--l. 292--><p class="indent" >   First, we will discuss the apatite fission track data (Figure <a 
href="#x1-40012">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:AFTages --></a>). Of the five Great Valley Group samples,
four have exclusively Cretaceous apatite fission track grain-ages, indicating that these grains never reached
temperatures greater than 110<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup>C since their deposition in the Great Valley Group. However,
sample JR2 has the oldest depositional age of these four samples but the youngest fission track
ages, with the latter being even slightly younger than the former. Therefore, JR2 has been
partially reset, and saw temperatures less than <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>110<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup>C, but well above <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>60<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup>C. The fission tracks
of sample JR2 are also significantly shorter than those of the other samples, an additional
suggestion that JR2 must have been heated to well within the partial annealing zone. Sample
JR1, located the nearest to the New Idria serpentite, has completely annealed apatite fission
tracks and, therefore, was heated above <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~ </span>110<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup>C. It dates the end of the heating event at <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>14
Ma. Sample JR6 from the Miocene Temblor Formation contains two age components: one
Cretaceous and one Miocene component (Table <a 
href="#x1-20021">1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:summary --></a>). There also is a hint of bimodality in the fission
track length distribution. A first group of relatively short (<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>9-13 <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BC;</span>m) fission tracks formed
prior to the mid-Miocene. These tracks preserve Sierran provenance ages but were partially
annealed during the mid-Miocene thermal event. A second group of long fission tracks (<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>13-17
<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03BC;</span>m) formed after this thermal event, and have not been annealed since then. Paleocurrent
directions in the Temblor and Big Blue Formations are west-to-east, which is the opposite flow
direction as for the Great Valley Group (Casey and Dickinson, 1976; Bate, 1985; Bent, 1985).
Therefore, the apatite grains of the Temblor Formation have been redeposited from the underlying
Great Valley Group, some of which was thermally annealed during a mid-Miocene thermal
event.<br

after its deposition. The lag between crystallization, exhumation and deposition times were short,
which means that the source area of these sediments exhumed rapidly. The most surprising
observation is that the Middle Miocene sample JR6, which had a bimodal apatite fission track age
distribution, also has a bimodal zircon fission track distribution. The oldest mode of Mesozoic ages is
compatible with the unreset fission track ages of the Joaquin Ridge samples located away
from the serpentinite body (Table <a

age distribution of JR6. Because not all the apatite grains in JR6 were reset at <span

know that this sample was not heated to more than <span

Ridge (see below). Therefore, the <span

deposition in the Temblor and Big Blue formations. Recalling the eastward paleocurrents
of these deposits, this indicates that at least part of the provenance area for the Temblor
Formation, which is Joaquin Ridge, reached temperatures as high as <span

<!--l. 373--><p class="indent" >   Additional evidence for a heating event comes from vitrinite reflectance data from two wells on
Joaquin Ridge (see Figure&#x00A0;<a

href="#x1-50014">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:vitrinite --></a> for the vitrinite reflectance data).
The &#8220;Joaquin Ridge #1&#8221; well is 4,390 m deep and located in the vicinity of sample JR3. The
&#8220;Christie #1&#8221; well is 1,380 m deep, and located next to sample JR2. Micro-paleontological
ages have been obtained for both wells (Martin B. Lagoe, written communication). &#8220;Joaquin
Ridge #1&#8221; sediments are of Coniacian (at 910 m) to Cenomanian age (at TD), whereas the
&#8220;Christie #1&#8221; samples at TD are Cenomanian (Figure <a 
href="#x1-50014">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:vitrinite --></a>). Twenty-three samples from the
&#8220;Joaquin Ridge #1&#8221; well were analyzed, from depths of 300 to 4,390 m. They show <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">R</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sub> values
of 0.6-1.5%, explaining why apatite fission track samples JR3, JR4, and JR5 have not been
thermally reset. These samples are all located upsection from the shallowest &#8220;Joaquin Ridge #1&#8221;
vitrinite reflectance samples and should, therefore, correspond to <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">R</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sub> values <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x003C; </span>0.6%, or maximum
paleo-temperatures less than <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>85<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">C </span>(Sweeney and Burnham, 1990). The &#8220;Joaquin Ridge #1&#8221; vitrinite
reflectance data imply a thermal gradient of <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>14 <sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup>C/km, which was normal in the Great
Valley forearc basin (Dumitru, 1988). There exists substantial evidence that the geothermal
gradient in the Great Valley Group was very low during the Cretaceous and the beginning of the
Tertiary. This is postulated to have been caused by the refrigerating effect of the subducting
Farallon pLate (Dumitru, 1988). The &#8220;Christie #1&#8221; well is located near sample JR2. Three cores
taken in &#8220;Christie #1&#8221; at 1,250-1,380 m are characterized by vitrinite reflectance values of
<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>1.9-2.0%, or maximum paleotemperatures of <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>180<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">C</span>, very hot for the Great Valley Group.
However, apatite fission track sample JR2, located about 1,500-2,000 m upsection from the
&#8220;Christie #1&#8221; vitrinite reflectance samples, has not been reset. Assuming a thermal gradient
similar to that inferred from the &#8220;Joaquin Ridge #1&#8221; well, this would lower the predicted
vitrinite reflectance value for sample JR2 to about <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">R</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sub> = 1.3% (maximum paleo-temperature
<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>150<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">C</span>). This rough estimate, if correct, conflicts with the observation that apatite fission track
sample JR2 has not been completely annealed. This would imply that the high <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">R</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sub> values of
&#8220;Christie #1&#8221; are due to a thermal anomaly, that the thermal gradient in this well was not
equal to that of &#8220;Joaquin Ridge #1&#8221;, and/or that this gradient was not linear. Although not
reset, sample JR2 has been at paleo-temperatures above those of samples JR3, JR4, and JR5.
The high paleo-temperatures of the &#8220;Christie #1&#8221; samples are unlikely to be the result of
simple burial, but are instead interpreted to be the result of a Middle Miocene heating spike,
associated with the upward protrusion and tectonic denudation of the New Idria serpentinite
body.

 id="x1-6000"></a>IMPLICATIONS FOR THE POST-DEPOSITIONAL HISTORY OF THE GREAT VALLEY
GROUP</h3>
<!--l. 421--><p class="noindent" >Partial annealing of apatite fission track sample JR2 and complete annealing of JR1 at <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>14 Ma by
burial-induced heating alone is improbable for at least two reasons:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Maximum  temperatures  of  the  Great  Valley  Group  on  Joaquin  Ridge  did  not  coincide
     with the timing of maximum burial. In the Panoche Hills area, north of Joaquin Ridge,
     subaerial exposure and erosion occured intermittently in the Paleocene and Eocene, and

     almost continuously since the Oligocene (Moxon, 1990; Bartow, 1991). Furthermore, deposits
     as old as the Eocene Kreyenhagen Formation of Oil Canyon, 10 kilometers north of Coalinga,
     contain biogenic silica in the form of opal-A (Milam, 1985), indicating that they were never
     heated above 28-56<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">C </span>(Murata and Larson, 1975). The total thickness of Tertiary deposits
     presently outcropping at the nose of Joaquin Ridge is only <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>1.5 km (Dibblee, 1971).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The age of the annealing (as dated by sample JR1) exactly coincides with the exhumation
     of the nearby New Idria serpentinite body (see the next paragraphs). It is unlikely that this
     coincidence is mere chance.</li></ul>
<!--l. 443--><p class="indent" >   An alternative explanation for the vitrinite reflectance and fission track data is that the Great Valley
Group was heated by the serpentinite diapir. Three lines of evidence suggest that the serpentinite body
was hot when it breached the surface. Most importantly, mineral assemblages of Franciscan inclusions in
the serpentinite body indicate that it rose from depths of as much as <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>20 km which, even under the
lowest thermal gradients, would make them relatively hot (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x003E;</span>200<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup>C; Coleman, 1996). Secondly, the
serpentinite diapir rose very rapidly. Evidence for the massive size and sudden nature of this event is
contained in the Middle Miocene Big Blue Formation, which crops out <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>15 km east of the
serpentinite dome. The Big Blue Formation consists almost entirely of serpentinite clasts, some of
which are house-sized (Anderson and Pack, 1915). Paleocurrents indicate flow towards the
east, in the opposite direction of the &#8220;normal&#8221; Great Valley Group paleocurrents (Casey and
Dickinson, 1976; Bate, 1985). The facies gradient from sheared protrusive serpentinite through
braided stream deposits to marine tidal flat facies evinces an eastward facing paleoslope (Bate,
1985). The fluvial deposits preserving paleocurrents were shed from the gradually spreading
flank of a New Idria serpentinite protrusion that breached the suface to form a dome-like
mass that spread laterally as additional serpentinite was supplied to the surface by upward
diapiric flowage from within the crust. If the serpentinite body rose to the surface extremely
rapidly, it is likely to have remained hot all that time. Finally, serpentinization reactions are

<!--l. 475--><p class="indent" >   Both of these reactions require a lot of water. This could be the reason why the serpentinization did
not happen before the Middle Miocene. At that time, the Mendocino triple junction passed the latitude of
Coalinga. The faulting and folding caused by the San Andreas fault might have introduced a pathway
for fluids in the ophiolitic crust that underlies the Great Valley Group. Both the reaction

minerals vary with temperature (Holland and Powell, 1998). At the conditions relevant to
the New Idria serpentinite dome, the pressure effect is negligible. Making the simplifying
assumption that serpentinization of the entire body occurred at the same time, we can calcuLate a
first-order approximation of the maximum temperature increase that could be caused by the
serpentinization:

recently collected from the Vallecitos oil field by the United States Geological Survey show
biomarker and isotope compositions indicative of Upper Eocene Kreyenhagen source rocks (written
communication, Kenneth E. Peters). However, the small pools in the syncline occur mainly in fault
traps located under the Kreyenhagen Formation (California Division of Oil and Gas, 1982).
Therefore, the Maastrichtian-Danian Moreno Formation might be a more plausible source of these
hydrocarbons. Although not understood in detail, the fault traps likely developed when the
syncline folded in the Late Middle Miocene (Rentschler, 1985). Thus, maturation, migration

<!--l. 579--><p class="noindent" >Most geochronological methods have a <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">closure temperature </span>(Dodson, 1973). However, in the apatite fission
track method for example, there is not one distinct temperature, but a rather diffuse zone over which the
geochronological system &#8220;closes&#8221;. Nevertheless, for our purposes, the rather crude concept of a closure
temperature is still useful. For the U/Pb system in zircon, the closure temperature is as high at
<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>900<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">C </span>(Dahl, 1997; Miller <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al.</span>, 2003). The closure temperature of the zircon fission track
method is somewhere between <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>230 and 310<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup>C (Wagner and Van den Haute, 1992; Tagami
and Dumitru, 1996). For the apatite fission track method, a closure temperature of <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>100<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup>C
can be used, although this value varies with apatite chemistry (e.g., Gleadow and Duddy,
1981).<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 593--><p class="indent" >   A frequent practice in igneous and metamorphic geochronology is the simultaneous use of several
dating techniques on the same sample. A graph of apparent age versus closure temperature is then used to
estimate the cooling history of such a sample (e.g., Harrison and McDougall, 1980). A similar approach
can be used for detrital samples. Conservatively assuming that the tops of the plutons in the southern
Sierra Nevada were emplaced at 2-3km depth (Ague and Brimhall, 1988), Surpless (2001) argued argued
that the relatively short minimum lag times between the U/Pb zircon ages and the depositional
ages of 3-15Ma indicated rapid exhumation of the Cretaceous Sierra Nevada at rates of <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>
0.6-1mm/yr. We can extend this method to the lower temperature thermochronometers of Table
<a 
href="#x1-20021">1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:summary --></a>.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 607--><p class="indent" >   If we had access to double-dated grains, as in Rahl <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al. </span>(2003), estimating the probability
distribution of provenance cooling rates would be a trivial exercise. However, because of the
uncontroversial provenance of our samples and the fact that the southern Sierra Nevada can be considered
a structurally more or less homogeneous fault block, we might be able to proceed without such data.
Thus, we can get a first order estimate of the cooling rates by looking at the time lag between the mean
(or central) ages of two thermochronological grain-age populations (e.g., ZFT and AFT), or at that

between the mean (or central) age of a grain-age population and the depositional age of the
sample.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 619--><p class="indent" >   Doing this for the thermally unreset data of Table <a 
href="#x1-20021">1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:summary --></a> yields seven apparent cooling rates which do not
show any systematic variation with depositional age. The weighted mean of these estimates yields an
apparent cooling rate of <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>21<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup>C/Ma. Depending on the thermal gradient (22-40<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup>C/km; Rothstein and
Manning, 2003), this then corresponds to exhumation rates of <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>0.5-1mm/yr, which agrees with the
estimates of Surpless (2001) and Ague and Brimhall (1988). These are rather high rates, but this does not
come as a surprise when we consider the amount of sediment deposited in the Great Valley Group at the
time.

<!--l. 640--><p class="indent" >   Figure <a 
href="#x1-80017">7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:JR6 --></a> summarizes the history of the Great Valley Group near Coalinga and New Idria:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The U/Pb, zircon and apatite fission track ages of unreset apatite and zircon show that the
     southern Sierra Nevada underwent rapid and steady exhumation during the Late Cretaceous.
     As the exhuming mountain range was eroded, it shed sediments in the Great Valley forearc
     basin. These sediments are presently exposed in a homocline on the eastern flank of the Diablo
     Range.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The Great Valley Group turbidites were buried to great depths, but under refrigerated thermal
     gradients, produced by Franciscan subduction (Dumitru, 1988).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">During the Middle to Late Miocene (<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>12-14 Ma), the Mendocino triple junction migrated
     from south to north to the west of Coalinga (Johnson and O&#8217;Neil, 1984). Its passage was
     associated with minor igneous activity, dated at <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>12.8 Ma (Obradovich <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al.</span>, 2000).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The faulting and folding caused by the San Andreas fault introduced fluids in the ophiolitic
     crust that underlies the Great Valley Group. These fluids reacted with the peridotitic rocks
     and formed serpentine minerals. Because of its low density and the relative ease with which it
     deformed, the serpentinite body rose rapidly. The combined effect of the folding and the rise
     of the serpentinite diapir caused substantial uplift of Joaquin Ridge, and secondary folding
     and faulting in the adjacent Vallecitos Syncline (Rentschler, 1985). Paleocurrent directions
     reversed, and re-sedimentation of Great Valley Group detritus formed the Middle Miocene
     Temblor and younger formations. The Big Blue came to the surface as a rising hot protrusion,
     heating the Great Valley Group on the way up and spreading at once over the countryside.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Because it formed at great depth or because the serpentinization reactions are exothermic,
     the New Idria serpentinite body was hot when it approached the surface, forming a thermal
     halo. The heating was sufficient to completely anneal apatites in the surrounding country
     rock and explain the relatively high vitrinite reflectance values that are observed near the
     contact between the Great Valley Group and the serpentinite body.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The  heat  released  by  the  serpentinite  produced  diagenetic  alteration  of  cristobalitic  to
     quartzose silica in the Moreno Shale, which underlies the Vallecitos syncline (Murata <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">et al.</span>,
     1979), pushing the source rocks of this basin into the thermal oil window.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Alternatively, it is possible that syenitic intrusions in the serpentinite body provided the
     &#8220;missing&#8221; heat source. However, we think that the serpentinite body itself is a more realistic
     alternative because it is size rather than temperature that determines the amount of time
     it takes for a hot body to cool, and the size of the resulting thermal halo. A small igneous
     intrusion may have been hotter than the serpentinite protrusion, but it would not be felt as
     long, and as far into the country rock.

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Deformation and folding continue in the Joaquin Ridge area today, witnessed by the 1983
     Coalinga earthquake. However, gravity data suggesting that the root of the New Idria body is
     only a few kilometers deep, imply that the exhumation of the serpentinite diapir has almost
     stopped (Byerly, 1966; Casey and Dickinson, 1976).</li></ul>
