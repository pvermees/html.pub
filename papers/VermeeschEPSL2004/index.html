<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >Single-grain age measurements have become a popular way to investigate detrital sedimentary provenance. Such
studies must fulfill an important condition that the measured sample is representative of the total detrital
population. Dodson <span 
class="pplri7t-">et al. </span><span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xdodson1988">1</a>]</span> argue that at least k=60 grains must be measured to reduce the chance to less than

p=5% that one particular fraction (in their case, the oldest) of the population is missed if this fraction is greater than
f=0.05, according to:

<!--l. 39--><p class="nopar" >
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   This equation has been used incorrectly (e.g. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xmorton1996">2</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xcawood2001">3</a>]</span>) to imply that 60 grains would be enough to have 95%
confidence that <span 
class="pplri7t-">any </span>fraction f<span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>0.05 of the population was not missed. It will be shown why this is not true (a proof
is given in Appendix A), and an alternative will be developed for studies that are interested in <span 
class="pplri7t-">all </span>age components,
rather than just one. While some studies use 60 grains for the wrong reason, other authors have used
even fewer grains, thereby increasing the likelihood of missing significant fractions of the detrital age
spectrum (e.g. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xrahl2003">4</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgrimmer2003">5</a>]</span>). However, it is not my intention to suggest that these are necessarily bad studies. In
addition to making recommendations for the number of sediment grains that should be dated in a
statistically adequate provenance study, this paper also suggests how to report data sets with fewer
measurements.

href="#x1-2004r3">3<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:3 --></a> are valid is 1/f. At larger values of M (or m),
p is kept constant. The shaded region on Figure <a 
href="#x1-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:1 --></a>a marks the area where this is the case. One way
to reduce the probability that fractions <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>f are missed when only k grains are dated is to reduce the
number of bins in the sample histogram. For example, if k=60, f=0.05, and p=20%, then M<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">opt</span></sub>=6 (Figure
<a 
href="#x1-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:1 --></a>). A detrital age-histogram that is constructed in this way conveys as much information about the
population as can be inferred from the sample and is statistically &#8221;allowed&#8221; by p and f. However, it is
less well suited for showing the sample distribution. Therefore, such a histogram should be used in
conjunction with markers for the sample data, or better still, a probability density plot <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xsilverman1986">6</a>]</span>. Such a
combined plot carries an optimal amount of information: the histogram represents the population with the
resolution that the data and the parameters p and f allow, while at the same time, the probability
density plot represents the data itself and the uncertainties that are associated with it (Figure <a 
href="#x1-20052">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:2 --></a>). M<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">opt</span></sub>
usually is a rather small number, much smaller than commonly used guidelines for the number of
histogram bins such as Sturges&#8217; rule <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xsturges1926">7</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xscott1992">8</a>]</span>. Using M<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">opt</span></sub> will tend to oversmooth the histogram, so
although it theoretically is a viable way to reduce the chance of missing significant fractions of the
population, there are better methods for dealing with datasets that contain fewer than the optimal

number of measurements. These methods are discussed in the following paragraph and the Conclusions
section.

class="cmmi-7">max</span></sub> vs. f curve
wherever M = 1/f. Figure <a 
href="#x1-40013">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:3 --></a> can be used for a quick assessment of the number of grains that are needed for a
provenance study, and of the risk of information loss that is caused by smaller samples. For example, if 60 grains
are dated, then <span 
class="cmmi-10">p</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">max</span></sub>=64%. Therefore, in the worst-case scenario (which, at m=20, is a perfectly uniform
population) there is 64% chance that at least one fraction <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>0.05 of the population is missed. This is
a dramatically different result from the 5% probability suggested by Equation <a 
href="#x1-1001r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:1 --></a>. Furthermore, the
actual fraction f<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">act</span></sub> that we can be sure not to have missed with 95% certainty is not 0.05, but 0.085, as
can be read from Figure <a 
href="#x1-40013">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:3 --></a>. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Figure <a 
href="#x1-40013">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:3 --></a> also shows that in order
to be 95% confident that no fraction <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>0.05 was missed, at least k=117 grains must be dated. Table 1
can be used to choose k, the number of grains required to lower p and f to some desired limits. If
fewer than this optimal number of grains have been dated, Table 2 can be used to estimate the actual
levels of p and f that have been achieved with that k. The same table also lists the value of <span 
class="cmmi-10">M</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">opt</span></sub> in
the unlikely event that the user prefers to reduce the resolution of the age histogram, rather than to
increase the desired p and/or f. Table 1 should be used before embarking on a provenance study to
determine how many grains are needed. Alternatively, Table 2 can be used for the interpretation of

provenance data with less than the optimal number of grains. For example, if only 30 grains have been
dated, Table 2 says that f<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">act</span></sub>=0.15 is the smallest fraction not missed at a 95% confidence level. Likewise,
there is 20% chance of missing at least one fraction representing <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>0.12 of the total population, and
the probability of missing at least one fraction <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>0.1 when 30 grains were dated is 37%. Finally, to
reduce the chance of missing at least one fraction <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>0.2 of the population to less than 10%, and still
only use 30 grains, the age-histogram cannot have more than M<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">opt</span></sub>=5 bins. As an alternative to Figure

populations differ from the worst-case distribution and it is less likely that statistically significant fractions of such
populations might be missed in a sample. As a consequence, fewer grains need dating to achieve the same levels of
f and p. A number of numerically-generated random populations are discussed next, followed by some real detrital
age-spectra.<br

<!--l. 229--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we will try to find the minimum number of grains that have to be dated to adequately represent an
&#8221;average&#8221; population, as opposed to the best- and worst-case populations of the previous section. We will assume
that all possible detrital populations of the geologic record are equally likely to occur. Such populations can be
synthetically generated by randomly selecting multinomial proportions from a uniform distribution. This

procedure is illustrated in Appendix B. Thus, for any specific number of fractions M, we generate a large number of
random populations (e.g. 1000). For each population, we construct a large number (e.g 200) of random samples
(again, see Appendix B for details). For each sample, the relevant population fractions are tested to
see if the sample contains at least one &#8221;grain age&#8221; that falls within it. If at least one of the relevant
fractions is empty, the test has failed. The ratio of the number of samples that failed the test to the
total number of samples represents an estimate of p. This process is repeated for a range of values for
M.

href="#x1-40024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:4 --></a> shows the result of this procedure for k=60 and f=0.05. For M ranging from one to 100, 1000
populations of that size were created. For each of these populations, 200 samples of k random numbers were
generated. For each value of M, a 5, 50, 95, 99 and 100% percentile was computed from the p-values of its 1000
random populations. The higher its &#8221;percentile&#8221;, the closer a synthetic population is to a uniform distribution. For
example, a &#8221;99 percentile&#8221; population is likely to be strongly multimodal, while a &#8221;5 percentile&#8221; population would
be more unimodal. All future plots in this paper that are derived from plots like Figure <a 
href="#x1-40024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:4 --></a> will only consider the 95%
percentile populations. That said, Figure <a 
href="#x1-40024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:4 --></a> is the numerical &#8221;intermediate-case&#8221; analogue to Figure <a 
href="#x1-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:1 --></a>. p
reaches a maximum value at M<span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2248;</span>35, and not at M=20, which would be the expected result when only
considering the fact that at M=20 (=1/f), the number of relevant fractions (m) reaches a maximum. The
reason why the peak is located at a higher M is that p is not only a function of m, but the result of a
tradeoff between the number of relevant fractions (m) and the total portion of the population that is
covered by these fractions, where the latter parameter steadily decreases with increasing M. From
Figure <a 
href="#x1-40024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:4 --></a> (which, as discussed before, is only valid for k=60 and f=0.05), the chance of missing at least
one fraction f<span

class="cmsy-10">&#x2264;</span>18.5% in 95% of the randomly generated
populations; p<span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2264;</span>25% in 99% of the populations; and p<span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span>30% in all 1000 populations. Not surprisingly, these
probabilities are significantly less than the 64% which was calculated for the worst-case scenario for the
same values of k, f and p with Equation <a 
href="#x1-2006r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:4 --></a>. However, even for samples from the median synthetic
population, the chance of missing at least one fraction <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>0.05 is more than the 5% which was the result of
the erroneous use of Equation <a

is less than 5% chance of missing at least one fraction <span

<!--l. 342--><p class="noindent" >Now that the theoretical foundations have been built to calculate the number of grains required for a statistically
adequate provenance study, they will be tested on real data. Unfortunately, no population is ever completely
known (certainly not if we consider that most published provenance studies work with fewer than 117 ages per
sample). Therefore, two relatively large published detrital data sets will be used as a proxy for the populations that
they were sampled from. By randomly selecting numbers from these &#8221;populations&#8221; with replacement, we can
generate synthetic samples. This procedure is similar to what is called &#8221;bootstrapping&#8221; in the statistical literature
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xefron1993">10</a>]</span>.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 354--><p class="indent" >   Avigad <span 
class="pplri7t-">et al. </span><span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xavigad2003">11</a>]</span> published a set of 157 concordant single zircon U/Pb ages from the Early Paleozoic Nubian
Sandstone. The vast majority of these grains are of Pan-African age (900-540 Ma) with relatively few older grains.
Therefore, the population is relatively &#8221;easy&#8221; to sample (Figure <a 
href="#x1-50016">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:6 --></a>). 1000 &#8221;bootstrap samples&#8221; of k numbers were
selected from the data set for each value of M between 1 and 50, where the latter value is assumed to be the highest
number of bins that one would ever want to use in a grain-age histogram. Similar to the algorithm that was
used in section <a 
href="#x1-40003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:numerical --></a>, the proportion of the 1000 samples that miss at least one of the relevant fractions
(f<span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>0.05) was calculated. This exercise was done for k=60, k=95 and k=117 (Figure <a 
href="#x1-50016">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:6 --></a>). The p<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">max</span></sub> vs. M
curve of this figure is much more irregular than that of Figures <a 
href="#x1-40024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:4 --></a> and <a 
href="#x1-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:1 --></a>, because it represents only one,
irregular population, and not the composite of a thousand random distributions (Figure <a 
href="#x1-40024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:4 --></a>), or one
smooth uniform analytical distribution (Figure <a 
href="#x1-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:1 --></a>). For k=60, the maximum value for p is 8.8%. As
expected, this is less than the 64% predicted by Equation <a 
href="#x1-2006r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:4 --></a>, but almost twice as much as predicted by
Equation <a 
href="#x1-1001r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:1 --></a>. The fact that even samples from this &#8221;easy&#8221; population have <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>5% chance of missing at
least one fraction <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>0.05 is another confirmation that 60 grains is not enough to attain the degree of
adequacy many would consider necessary for a good provenance study. The maximum probability
of missing any fraction <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>0.05 is reduced to 1.5% when 95 grains are dated, and if k=117, p is only
0.9%.

 id="x1-60004"></a>Conclusions and recommendations</h3>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The optimal number of grains that should be dated of a detrital provenance sample can be looked up
     from Table 1, Figure <a 
href="#x1-40013">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:3 --></a>, or the web-form <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xwebform">9</a>]</span>. To be 95% certain that no fraction <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>0.05 of the population
     was missed, 117 grains should be dated. This is a fairly large number, often too high perhaps for
     analytical methods such as fission-track, (U-Th)/He, or TIMS. 117 measurements may be more readily
     achievable with the ion-microprobe (e.g. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xavigad2003">11</a>]</span>) or laser ablation ICP-MS (e.g. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xdickinson2003">13</a>]</span>).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">If  there  exists  some  prior  knowledge  about  the  population  that  indicates  it  is  not  uniformly
     distributed, a risk can be taken to date fewer that the optimal number of grains, by using Figure <a 
href="#x1-40035">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:5 --></a>.
     To be 95% certain that no fraction f<span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>0.05 was missed, it is recommended that this number be no less
     than 95. However, dating fewer grains limits the possibility to rigorously calculate and report p and
     f.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">It  is  definitely  not  the  purpose  of  this  paper  to  suggest  that  studies  reporting  fewer  than  117
     single-grain measurements would be scientifically wrong. The purpose of some provenance studies
     may be to prove the <span 
class="pplri7t-">presence </span>of one or more specific age fractions in a detrital population. Once these
     fractions have been found, there is no reason to date more grains. It is only when provenance studies
     discuss the <span 
class="pplri7t-">absence </span>of certain age fractions that counting statistics come into play. Even then, it may
     not be possible to date as many as 117 grains for technical, financial or other reasons. If fewer than 117
     grains were dated per sample, or when age-histograms must be interpreted from published studies
     that use fewer than the optimal number of grains, the actual p<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">max</span></sub> and f values that result from using
     the available number of grain ages should be reported. For example: if only 60 grains were dated, it is
     sufficient to report that the maximum probability of missing at least one fraction greater than 0.05 is
     p<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">max</span></sub>=64%, <span 
class="pplri7t-">or </span>that there is 95% confidence that no fraction f<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">act</span></sub> <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>0.085 was missed. Note that the latter
     definitely sounds better than the former. Such information can be obtained from Equation <a

href="#x1-40013">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:3 --></a>,

     Table 2, or the web-form <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xwebform">9</a>]</span>. In theory, an alternative solution to changing p and f would be to reduce
     the number of bins of the age histogram to M<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">opt</span></sub>, according to Table 2 or the web-form <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xwebform">9</a>]</span>. However,
     M<sub><span

<!--l. 610--><p class="noindent" >In addition to the worst-case scenario, a best-case scenario can also be considered given a certain number
of relevant fractions (m). If the number of relevant fractions is not known, the lowest possible p is
always associated with a delta function (one single age component). For the latter population p equals
zero, which is an information-free trivial result. For example, if m = 3, the best-case scenario is given

   <div class="minipage"><!--l. 639--><p class="noindent" >Consider a specific value for M (the number of fractions), for example M=7. A population is generated by
selecting an array of M-1 random numbers between zero and one, drawn from a uniform distribution (x<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">i</span></sub>,
with i=1...6). This array is sorted and padded with a leading zero and a trailing one, becoming of size M+1.

<!--l. 649--><p class="noindent" >The difference between subsequent numbers in the array is a new array of size M (f<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">j</span></sub>, with j=1...7), in which each
element represents a fraction of the total population. The population, when generated in this way, is automatically
normalized to one.

<!--l. 658--><p class="noindent" >Random samples are generated by choosing k (for example 20) random numbers between zero and one, also from a
uniform distribution. On the following figure, these numbers are marked by black dots. Each of the
relevant fractions (&#8221;boxes&#8221;) of the population is tested to see if the sample contains at least one number
(&#8221;dot&#8221;) that falls within it. On the next figure, the relevant fraction size f is marked by a gray bar. If at
least one of the relevant fractions is empty, the test has failed. This is the case for our example, since
the third box is empty and f<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">3</span></sub> <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2265;</span>f. Note that fraction #7 is also empty, but this is irrelevant because

<!--l. 675--><p class="noindent" >For each population, the ratio of the number of samples that failed the test to the total number of samples

represents one estimate of p. This procedure is repeated for a large number of synthetically generated
populations. The iterative process becomes of third order when a range of M values is evaluated (Figure
