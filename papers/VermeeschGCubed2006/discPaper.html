class="cmr-9">The decision boundaries of most tectonic discrimination diagrams are drawn by eye. Discriminant</span>
     <span 
class="cmr-9">analysis is a statistically more rigorous way to determine the tectonic affinity of oceanic basalts based on</span>
     <span 
class="cmr-9">their bulk-rock chemistry. This method was applied to a database of 756 oceanic basalts of known tectonic</span>
     <span 
class="cmr-9">affinity (ocean island, mid-ocean ridge, or island arc). For each of these training data, up to 45 major,</span>
     <span 
class="cmr-9">minor and trace elements were measured. Discriminant analysis assumes multivariate normality. If the</span>
     <span 
class="cmr-9">same covariance structure is shared by all the classes (i.e., tectonic affinities), the decision boundaries are</span>
     <span 
class="cmr-9">linear, hence the term linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In contrast with this, quadratic discriminant</span>
     <span 
class="cmr-9">analysis (QDA) allows the classes to have different covariance structures. To solve the statistical problems</span>
     <span 
class="cmr-9">associated with the constant-sum constraint of geochemical data, the training data must be transformed</span>
     <span 
class="cmr-9">to log-ratio space before performing a discriminant analysis. The results can be mapped back to the</span>
     <span 
class="cmr-9">compositional data space using the inverse log-ratio transformation. An exhaustive exploration of 14,190</span>
     <span 
class="cmr-9">possible ternary discrimination diagrams yields the Ti-Si-Sr system as the best linear, and the Na-Nb-Sr</span>
     <span 
class="cmr-9">system  as  the  best  quadratic  discrimination  diagram.  The  best  linear  and  quadratic  discrimination</span>
     <span 
class="cmr-9">diagrams using only immobile elements are Ti-V-Sc and Ti-V-Sm, respectively. As little as 5% of the</span>

     <span 
class="cmr-9">Although QDA misclassifies fewer training data than LDA, the opposite is generally true for the test</span>
     <span

     <span

<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >Recovering the tectonic affinity of ancient ophiolites is a problem of great scientific interest. In addition to field data,
basalt geochemistry is another way to address this problem. Tectonic discrimination diagrams have been a popular
technique for doing this since the publication of landmark papers by Pearce and Cann (1971, 1973). This paper
revisits some of the popular discrimination diagrams that have been in use since then. Nearly all discrimination
diagrams that are currently in use were drawn by eye. The present paper revisits these diagrams in a statistically
more rigorous way.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   First, a short introduction will be given to the discriminant analysis method. The fundamental difference
between the reduction in dimensionality achieved by principal components and by linear discriminant analysis will
be explained. Then, the consequences of the constant-sum constraint of geochemical data for discriminant analysis
will be discussed. In Section <a 
href="#x1-40004">4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:aitchison --></a>, Aitchison&#8217;s (1982, 1986) solution to this problem will be briefly explained. Section <a 
href="#x1-50005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:revisit --></a>
revisits some of the historically most important and popular discrimination diagrams, based on a new database of
oceanic basalts of known tectonic affinity. The effect of data-closure will be taken into account and a
statistically rigorous re-evaluation of these diagrams will be made in both the linear and the quadratic
case.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   This paper does not restrict itself to only those geochemical features that have already been used by previous
workers. Section <a 
href="#x1-90006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:exhaustive --></a> gives an exhaustive exploration of all possible bivariate and ternary discrimination diagrams
using a set of 45 major, minor, and trace elements. This will result in a list of the 100 best linear and quadratic
ternary discriminators, ranked according to their success in classifying the training data. Finally, Section <a 
href="#x1-120007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:test --></a> tests the
most important discrimination diagrams discussed elsewhere in the paper on a second database of oceanic basalts
that were not part of the training data. This provides a more objective estimator of misclassification risk on future
data than the misclassification rate of the training data. Section <a 
href="#x1-120007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:test --></a> also contains a formal comparison of the new
decision boundaries with the old ones of Pearce and Cann (1973), Shervais (1982), Meschede (1986) and
Wood (1980). It will be shown that the new decision boundaries perform at least as well as the old
ones.

<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >Consider a dataset of a large number of N-dimensional data X, which belong to one of K classes. For example, X
might be a set of geochemical data (e.g., SiO<sub><span

class="cmr-7">2</span></sub>O<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">3</span></sub>,etc) from basaltic rocks of K tectonic affinities (e.g., mid
ocean ridge, ocean island, island arc,...). We might ask ourselves which of these classes an unknown sample x belongs
to. This question is answered by <span 
class="cmti-10">Bayes&#8217; Rule</span>: the decision d is the class G (1<span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2264;</span>G<span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2264;</span>K) that has the highest <span

<img

which we will consider uniformly distributed (i.e., Pr(G=1) = Pr(G=2) = ... = Pr(G=K) = 1/K) in this paper.

<!--l. 158--><p class="nopar" >
<!--l. 160--><p class="indent" >   This is the basis of <span 
class="cmti-10">linear discriminant analysis </span>(LDA), which has some desirable properties. For example,
because Equation <a 
href="#x1-2005r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:linRule --></a> is linear in x, the decision boundaries between the different classes are straight lines (Figure <a 
href="#x1-190007">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:linDisc --></a>).
Furthermore, LDA can lead to a significant reduction in dimensionality, in a similar way to <span 
class="cmti-10">principal component</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">analysis </span>(PCA). PCA finds an orthogonal transformation B (i.e., a rotation) that transforms the centered data (X)
to orthogonality, so that the elements of the vector BX are uncorrelated. B can be calculated by an eigenvalue
decomposition of the covariance matrix &#x03A3;. The eigenvectors are orthogonal linear combinations of the original
variables, and the eigenvalues give their variances. The first few principal components generally account
for most of the variability of the data, constituting a significant reduction of dimensionality (Figure
<a 
href="#x1-190022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:PCAvsLDA --></a>).<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >   Like PCA, LDA also finds linear combinations of the original variables. However, this time, we do not want to
maximize the overall variability, but find the orthogonal transformation Z = BX that maximizes the <span 
class="cmti-10">between class</span>
variance S<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">b</span></sub> relative to the <span 
class="cmti-10">within class </span>variance S<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">w</span></sub>, where S<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">b</span></sub> is the variance of the class means of Z, and S<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">w</span></sub> is the
pooled variance about the means (Figure <a 
href="#x1-190022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:PCAvsLDA --></a>).

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>The compositional data problem</h3>
<!--l. 186--><p class="noindent" >One of the assumptions of discriminant analysis is that the elements of X are statistically <span 
class="cmti-10">independent </span>from each
other, apart from the covariance structure contained in their multivariate normality. However, geochemical
data are generally expressed as parts of a whole (percent or ppm) and, therefore, are not free to vary
independently from each other. For example, in a three-component system (A+B+C=100%), increasing one
component (e.g., A) causes a decrease in the two other components (B and C). The constant-sum
constraint has several consequences, besides introducing a negative bias into correlations between
components. One of these consequences is that the arithmetic mean of compositional data has no
physical meaning (Figure <a 
href="#x1-190033">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:closure --></a>). This is very unfortunate because some popular discrimination diagrams
(e.g., Pearce and Cann, 1973) are based on the arithmetic means of multiple samples, and it is these
averages that are published in the literature. Therefore, the discriminant analyses discussed in this paper
will not be based on these historic datasets, but will use a newly compiled database of individual
analyses.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 207--><p class="indent" >   Another statistical issue that deserves to be mentioned is <span 
class="cmti-10">spurious correlation</span>. Bivariate plots of the form X vs.
X/Y, X vs. Y/X or X/Z vs. Y/Z can show some degree of correlation, even when X, Y and Z are completely
independent from each other (Figure <a 
href="#x1-190044">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:spurious --></a>). This effect was first discussed more than a century ago by
Pearson (1897), and was brought to the attention of geologists more than half a century ago by Chayes
(1949). Spurious correlation is an effect that should be borne in mind when interpreting discrimination
diagrams like the Zr/Y-Ti/Y diagram (Pearce and Gale, 1977), the Zr/Y-Zr diagram (Pearce and
Norry, 1979), or the Ti/Y-Nb/Y and K<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub>O/Yb-Ta/Yb diagrams (Pearce, 1982). Note that whereas
in Figure <a 
href="#x1-190044">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:spurious --></a>, X, Y and Z are completely independent, this is never the case for compositional data,
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
due to the constant-sum constraint described before. This only aggravates the problem of spurious
correlation.

<!--l. 226--><p class="noindent" >Although Chayes (1949, 1960, 1971) made significant contributions to the compositional data problem, the real
breakthrough was made by Aitchison (1982, 1986). Aitchison argues that N-variate data constrained to a constant
sum form an N-1 dimensional sample space or <span 
class="cmti-10">simplex</span>. An example of a simplex for N=3 is the ternary diagram
(e.g., Weltje, 2002). The very fact that it is possible to plot ternary data on a two-dimensional sheet of paper tells us
that the sample space really has only two, and not three dimensions. The &#8220;traditional&#8221; statistics of real space
(<span 
class="msbm-10">&#x211D;</span><sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">N</span></sup>) do no longer work on the simplex (&#x0394;<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">N</span><span 
class="cmsy-7">-</span><span 
class="cmr-7">1</span></sub>). Figure <a 
href="#x1-190055">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:closure_ternary_wrong --></a> shows the breakdown of the calculation of
100(1-<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>)% confidence intervals on &#x0394;<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub>. Treating &#x0394;<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub> the same way as <span 
class="msbm-10">&#x211D;</span><sup><span 
class="cmr-7">3</span></sup> yields 95% confidence polygons
that partly fall outside the ternary diagram, corresponding to meaningless negative values of x, y and
z.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 242--><p class="indent" >   As a solution to this problem, Aitchison suggested to transform the data from &#x0394;<sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">N</span><span

using the <span 
class="cmti-10">log-ratio transformation </span>(Figure <a 
href="#x1-190066">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:closure_mapping --></a>). After performing the desired (&#8220;traditional&#8221;) statistical
analysis on the transformed data in <span

class="cmmi-7">N</span><span

class="cmmi-7">N</span><span 
class="cmsy-7">-</span><span 
class="cmr-7">1</span></sub> using the
inverse log-ratio transformation. For example, in the ternary system (X+Y+Z=1), we could use the
transformed values V = log(X/Z) and W = log(Y/Z). Alternatively, we could also use V=log(X/Y)
and W=log(Z/Y), or V=log(Y/X) and W=log(Z/X). The inverse log-ratio transformation is given

Not all samples were analysed for all the components. The dataset of major oxides is redundant, but a rescaling
from % to ppm is avoided by treating it separately. Being admitted to the GEOROC and PETDB databases, it was
assumed that the training data are reliable. Each datapoint in the electronic appendix is associated with a unique
ID that allows the user to recover the original publication source. Different normalization procedures were used for
different datasets, but this is unlikely to have major consequences for the discriminant analysis. So
many data sources are mixed that at most, this mixing of normalization and laboratory procedures
would have induced some additional random uncertainty, with only minor effects on the actual decision
boundaries. Mixing different data sources and normalization procedures in the training data has the
positive side-effect that the user is more or less free to use whichever normalization procedure (s)he

<!--l. 362--><p class="indent" >   First, two simple bivariate discrimination diagrams will be discussed: the Ti-V diagram of Shervais (1982) and
the Ti-Zr diagram of Pearce and Cann (1973). Many of the problems that plague the study of compositional data
and were discussed in Section <a 
href="#x1-30003">3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:compositionalProblems --></a> are far less serious in the bivariate than the ternary case. Of course, Ti and V, or Ti
and Zr are still subject to the (physical) constant-sum constraint, but considering they typically consitute less than
a few percent of the total rock composition, a change in one element will have little effect on the other one
when the raw measurement units are used on the axes of the bivariate discrimination diagrams. In
contrast with this, all popular ternary discrimination diagrams have been rescaled to a (diagrammatic)
constant sum of 100%, thus magnifying the effects of closure. For all of the following discriminant
analyses, a uniform prior was used. Statistical analysis was done with a combination of Matlab<sup><span 
class="cmsy-10">©</span></sup> and <span 
class="cmtt-10">R</span>
(<span 
class="cmtt-10">http://www.r-project.org</span>).<br 
class="newline" />
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60005.1"></a>Binary discrimination diagrams</h4>
<!--l. 382--><p class="noindent" >For the Ti-V system, the data were transformed to the simplex by the log-ratio transformation. Thus, two new
variables were created: log(Ti/(10<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">6</span></sup>-Ti-V)) and log(V/(10<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">6</span></sup>-Ti-V)), where 10<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">6</span></sup> is the constant sum of 1 million ppm.
The discriminant analysis then proceeds as described in Section <a 
href="#x1-20002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:discriminant --></a>. The results are mapped back to bivariate Ti-V
space using the inverse log-ratio transformation (Equation <a 
href="#x1-4001r6">6<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:inverse_transform --></a>). Figure <a 
href="#x1-1901111">11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Ti_V_lin --></a> shows the results of the LDA of the Ti-V
system, whereas Figure <a 
href="#x1-1901212">12<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Ti_V_quad --></a> shows the QDA results. The decision boundaries look almost identical for both cases.
Besides the decision boundaries, Figures <a 
href="#x1-1901111">11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Ti_V_lin --></a>, <a 
href="#x1-1901212">12<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Ti_V_quad --></a> and subsequent figures also show the training data as well as the
posterior probabilities. One of the properties of many <span 
class="cmti-10">data mining </span>algorithms, including discriminant analysis, is
the &#8220;garbage in, garbage out&#8221; principle: any rock that was analysed for the required elements will be
classified as either IAB, MORB or OIB, even continental basalts, granites or sandstones! Therefore, it is
recommended to treat the classification of samples plotting far outside the range of the training data with
caution.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 402--><p class="indent" >   In contrast with the Ti-V diagram, the decision boundaries of the Ti-Zr system look quite different between LDA
(Figure <a 
href="#x1-1901313">13<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Ti_Zr_lin --></a>) and QDA (Figure <a 
href="#x1-1901414">14<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Ti_Zr_quad --></a>). The misclassification risk of the training data (i.e., the <span 
class="cmti-10">resubstitution error</span>) of
QDA is always less than that of LDA, because the former uses more parameters than the latter. However, this does
not necessarily mean that QDA will perform better on <span 
class="cmti-10">future </span>datasets. This problem will be discussed in Section <a 
href="#x1-120007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:test --></a>.
For now, suffice it to say that the resubstitution error can be used to compare two binary or two ternary diagrams
with each other, but not to compare the performance of QDA with LDA or of a binary with a ternary
diagram.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-70005.2"></a>Ternary discrimination diagrams</h4>
<!--l. 418--><p class="noindent" >The procedure for performing a discriminant analysis for ternary systems is very similar to the binary case. For
example, for the Ti-Zr-Y system of Pearce and Cann (1973), we first impose the constant sum constraint: x =
Y/(Ti+Zr+Y), y = Zr/(Ti+Zr+Y) and z = Ti/(Ti+Zr+Y). The log-ratio transformed variables are V
= log(x/z) and W = log(y/z). Note that this transformation only takes care of the diagrammatic
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
constraint x+y+z = 1. Strictly speaking, it does not account for the physical constraint Ti+Zr+Y+(all
other elements) = 100%. However, Ti+Zr+Y only amount to at most a few percent of typical basalt
compositions, thereby greatly reducing the impact of this second type of constant sum. It would be possible to
correct for the physical constraint, for example by performing a discriminant analysis on the following
three variables: log(Ti/(10<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">6</span></sup>-Ti-Zr-Y)), log(Zr/(10<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">6</span></sup>-Ti-Zr-Y)), and log(Y/(10<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">6</span></sup>-Ti-Zr-Y)). However, the
results of such an analysis can no longer be plotted on a ternary diagram. In practice, neglecting the
physical constant sum constraint does not severely affect the performance of the classification in this
case.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 437--><p class="indent" >   Figures <a 
href="#x1-1901515">15<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Ti_Zr_Y_lin --></a> and <a 
href="#x1-1901616">16<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Ti_Zr_Y_quad --></a> show the results of both LDA and QDA transformed back to the Ti-Zr-Y ternary diagram.
The raw variables of many discrimination diagrams are multiplied by constants to improve the spread of the data.
This is equivalent to adding constants to the log-ratio transformed variables. Either transformation does not affect
the discriminant analysis. As noted by Pearce and Cann (1973), the Ti-Zr-Y diagram is quite good at identifying
OIBs, but cannot distinguish MORBs from IABs. The training data of the latter substantially overlap and their
resubstitution errors are quite high. The posterior probabilies of the training data are low (<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x003C;</span>0.5 on Figure
<a 
href="#x1-1901616">16<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Ti_Zr_Y_quad --></a>).<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 449--><p class="indent" >   This is also the case for the Nb-Zr-Y system of Meschede (1986) (Figures <a 
href="#x1-1901717">17<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Nb_Zr_Y_lin --></a> and <a 
href="#x1-1901818">18<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Nb_Zr_Y_quad --></a>). The high misclassification
rate of both the Ti-Zr-Y and Nb-Zr-Y diagrams is largely caused by the large spread of IAB compositions, which is
likely caused by the complexity of magma generation underneath island arcs, where mixing of multiple melt sources
often occurs. The Th-Ta-Hf system of Wood (1980), however, achieves a much better separation between the three
tectonic affinities (Figures <a 
href="#x1-1901919">19<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Th_Ta_Hf_lin --></a> and <a 
href="#x1-1902020">20<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Th_Ta_Hf_quad --></a>). The decision boundaries of the QDA (Figure <a 
href="#x1-1902020">20<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Th_Ta_Hf_quad --></a>) are much more
complicated than those of the LDA (Figure <a 
href="#x1-1901919">19<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Th_Ta_Hf_lin --></a>), without substantially improving the overall misclassification
risk. Therefore, adding the extra parameters (covariances) was probably not worthwhile (see Section
<a 
href="#x1-120007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:test --></a>).

<!--l. 466--><p class="noindent" >As illustrated by Figure <a 
href="#x1-190022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:PCAvsLDA --></a>, LDA offers the possibility of projecting a dataset onto a subspace of lower
dimensionality. As explained in Section <a 
href="#x1-20002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:discriminant --></a> this procedure is related to, but quite different from PCA.
Therefore, it is somewhat puzzling why Butler and Woronow (1986) performed a PCA on a dataset of Zr,
Ti, Y and Sr analyses of oceanic basalts. These authors were the first to note the significance of the
constant sum constraint to the problem of tectonic discrimination, but they stopped short of doing a full
discriminant analysis. Figure <a

<!--l. 488--><p class="indent" >   Butler and Woronow (1986) were the first ones to note the potential importance of data-closure in the context of
tectonic discimination of oceanic basalts. However, as said before, they did not use the log-ratio transformation to
improve discriminant analysis, but performed a PCA instead, the implications of which are unclear. On the other
hand, Pearce (1976) did perform a traditional multi-element discriminant analysis, but since his paper predated the
work of Aitchison (1982, 1986), he was unaware of the effects of closure. Figure <a

meaning, in contrast with their binary and ternary counterparts.

different scale, the lower left triangular parts of the matrices show the resubstitution errors of the 55 possible
bivariate LDAs. For example, the lower left triangular matrices of Figure <a 
href="#x1-1902323">23<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:major2lin --></a> show that only 13.5% of
IABs, 15.2% of MORBs and 7.4% of OIBs were misclassified by an LDA using TiO<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub> and K<sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub>O. The
overall resubstitution error is 12%. The upper right triangular parts of the same figure show that 229
out of 256 IABs, 230 out of 241 MORBs and 203 out of 259 OIBs were used for the construction of
the LDA, accounting for a total of 662 out of 756 training data. Figure <a

whole, Ti jumps out as the apparently best overall discriminator. One might think that the Tm-Sc diagram
performs very well, considering that the overall error (shown in the upper right triangle of the lower right matrix of
Figure <a 
href="#x1-1902525">25<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:trace2lin --></a>) is only 7.7%. 12% of the IABs, 8.8% of the OIBs and only 2.4% of the MORBs in the training data were
misclassified. However, the upper right triangular matrices of the same figure show that only 101 of 756 training
data were used for the classification. Only 25/256 of the IABs, 42/241 of the MORBs and 34/259 of the OIBs were
analysed for both Tm and Sc, thereby greatly reducing the reliability of the classification. Figure <a

results of all possible bivariate QDAs for the database of 45 elements. The strikingly different colors of the lower
triangular matrices on this figure illustrate the difficulties in classifying IABs. Both MORBs and IABs are
relatively easy to separate, but the geochemical variability of IABs is much larger, for reasons discussed
before.<br

<!--l. 580--><p class="noindent" >As calculated in the previous section, there are 990 ways to choose three out of 11 major oxides, and 14,190 ways to
choose three out of 45 major, minor and trace elements. Although all these possibilities were explored in the
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
framework of this research, it is not practical to visually show all the results in this paper, even using the highly
compact matrix visualization. Therefore, only an (important) subset is shown of all ternary diagrams using Ti. As
discussed before, many of the most effective bivariate discriminant analyses use Ti. In addition to being an excellent
discriminator, Ti is also highly immobile, in contrast with for example Sr, which is another powerful discriminator.
For these reasons, only the results of ternary LDAs and QDAs using Ti are shown in Figures <a 
href="#x1-1902727">27<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:major3lin --></a>, <a 
href="#x1-1902828">28<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:major3quad --></a>, <a

class="newline" />
<!--l. 594--><p class="indent" >   The resubstitution errors of all 14,190 ternary LDAs (i.e., not only those using Ti) were ranked to find the best
combinations of elements. Table <a 
href="#x1-17001r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:bestLinear --></a> shows the 100 best LDAs. Only those diagrams for which at least 100 IABs, 100
MORBs and 100 OIBs of the training data had been analysed for all three elements were used. 2,333 out of 14,190
possible combinations fulfilled this requirement. The best ternary LDA uses the Si-Ti-Sr system. It has an overall
resubstitution error of 6.2%, (2.7% for IABs, 2.8% for MORBs and 2.7% for OIBs), using nearly all the training
data (221/256 IABs, 211/241 MORBs and 192/259 OIBs). Figure <a 
href="#x1-1903131">31<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Si_Ti_Sr_lin --></a> shows the Si-Ti-Sr LDA in detail.
Another powerful ternary diagram using minor and trace elements is the Eu-Lu-Sr system, which
ranks third among all the ternary LDAs of Table <a 
href="#x1-17001r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:bestLinear --></a>. This diagram is shown on Figure <a 
href="#x1-1903232">32<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Eu_Lu_Sr_lin --></a>. Many if
not most of the best performing ternary LDAs use Sr as one of the elements. However, as discussed
before, Sr is quite mobile during processes of alteration and metamorphism, potentially affecting the
reliability of the discrimination diagrams using it. The Ti-V-Sc diagram, ranking 28th in Table <a 
href="#x1-17001r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:bestLinear --></a>, suffers
much less from this problem and still has an overall misclassification rate of only 10.4% while using
374 out of 756 training data. Figure <a 
href="#x1-1903333">33<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:V_Ti_Sc_lin --></a> shows the Ti-V-Sc diagram in detail. Table <a 
href="#x1-17003r2">2<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:bestLinearIncompatible --></a> lists the best
performing (lowest resubstitution error) ternary LDAs, using the following 25 incompatible elements: Ti,
La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Sc, V, Cr, Y, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, Pb, Th, and
U.<br

resubstitution error of only 5%. As shown on Figure <a 
href="#x1-1903434">34<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Na_Nb_Sr_quad --></a>, this diagram misclassifies only 22 out of 425 training
samples. However, Na is a very mobile element and not much faith can be had in a classification that uses it for
basalt samples that are not perfectly fresh. The Ti-V-Sm diagram (Figure <a 
href="#x1-1903535">35<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:V_Ti_Sm_quad --></a>) is the best-performing QDA using
only relatively immobile elements. It is ranked 33rd in Table <a 
href="#x1-17005r3">3<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:bestQuadratic --></a>. Notice that both for LDA and QDA, the
best-performing ternary discrimination diagrams using immobile elements contain both Ti and V, apparently
confirming the effectiveness of the approach used by Shervais (1982). The latter author selected Ti
and V for mostly petrological reasons, while the present paper arrived at the same elements using an
entirely statistical method. The compatibility of both approaches lends more credibility to the results.
Table <a

<!--l. 644--><p class="noindent" >Some of the discrimination diagrams of the previous section were extremely good at classifying the training data.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
However, as briefly mentioned in Section <a 
href="#x1-50005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:revisit --></a>, the resubstitution error is not the best way to assess performance on
future data. Furthermore, QDA nearly always performed better than LDA, because the former involves more
parameters than the latter. As the number of parameters in a model increases, its ability to resolve even the smallest
subtleties in the training data improves. In a regression context, this would correspond to adding terms to a
polynomial interpolator (Figure <a 
href="#x1-1903636">36<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:biasVariance --></a>). For a very large number of parameters (equaling or exceeding the
number of datapoints), the curve will eventually pass through all the points and the &#8220;error&#8221; (e.g.,
squared distance) will become zero. In other words, the high order polynomial model has zero <span 
class="cmti-10">bias</span>.
However, unbiased models rarely are the best predictive models, because they suffer from high <span 
class="cmti-10">variance</span>.
High-order polynomial models built on different sets of training data are likely to look significantly different
because of irreproducible random variations in the sampling or measuring process. On the other hand, a
one-parameter linear model will have low variance, but can be very biased (e.g., when the true model is
really polynomial). This phenomenon is called the <span 
class="cmti-10">bias-variance tradeoff</span>, and exists for all <span 
class="cmti-10">data mining</span>
methods.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 667--><p class="indent" >   By assuming equal covariance between the different classes of the training data, LDA is a very crude
approximation of the data space. Therefore, it is likely to be quite biased in many cases. However, because of the
bias-variance tradeoff, the variance of the LDAs described in previous sections is low. Therefore, the resubstitution
error might actually be a decent estimator of future performance. However, things are different for QDA because it
estimates the covariance of each of the classes from the training data, thereby dramatically increasing the number of
parameters in the model. Although this reduces the bias (i.e., a QDA describes the training data better than
an LDA), it causes an increased variance. For example, some of the intricate structure of Figures <a 
href="#x1-1901616">16<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Ti_Zr_Y_quad --></a>
or <a 
href="#x1-1902020">20<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Th_Ta_Hf_quad --></a> might not be very stable. Therefore, the resubstution error is not a good predictor of future
performance. It must also not be used for comparing the performances of bivariate and ternary discrimination
diagrams.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 684--><p class="indent" >   The easiest way to obtain a more objective estimate of future performance is to use a second database of <span 
class="cmti-10">test</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">data</span>, which had not been used for the construction of the discrimination diagrams. Implementing this idea, a
database of 182 test data was compiled from three locations:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">67 IABs from the Aleutian arc.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">55 MORBs from the Galapagos ridge.

href="#x1-20002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:discriminant --></a>, the decision boundaries are linear for LDA in log-ratio space. To
allow an easy reproduction of these decision boundaries, four &#8220;anchor points&#8221; are provided for each

of the decision boundaries of Shervais (1982), Pearce and Cann (1976), Meschede (1986) and Wood
(1980) with the new decision boundaries constructed using LDA and QDA. Although it is hard to
make a definite comparison due to the relatively small size of the effectively used test dataset, the new
decision boundaries seem to always perform at least as well as the old ones. Because the test dataset is
much smaller than the training dataset, it is more likely affected by the missing-data problem. For
example, the test data contained no MORBs that had been simultaneously analysed for Th, Ta and
Hf. For all the discrimination diagrams of Table <a 
href="#x1-17009r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:errEst --></a>, QDA performs better than LDA on the training
data. On the other hand, LDA often performs better than QDA on the test data because of its lower
variance. For example, LDA misclassified 17 out of 85 test samples using Ti, Zr and Y, whereas QDA
misclassified 38 using the same three elements (Table <a 
href="#x1-17009r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:errEst --></a>). However, in most cases the difference is not so
dramatic.

 id="x1-130008"></a>Conclusions</h3>
<!--l. 730--><p class="noindent" >This paper revisited the observation by Butler and Woronow (1986) that traditional statistical analyses of
geochemical data is flawed because it ignores the effects of data-closure. Since the work of Aichison (1982,
1986), it is possible to account and correct for the constant-sum constraint by transforming the data to
log-ratio space. Butler and Woronow (1986) then went on to do a principal component analysis. The
present paper instead uses the log-ratio method for the related, albeit different technique of discriminant
analysis.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 739--><p class="indent" >   First, a number of popular discrimination diagrams were revisited. Many of these historically important
diagrams were not derived from a real discriminant analysis <span 
class="cmti-10">sensu </span>Fisher (1936), but were instead obtained by
drawing decision boundaries by eye. A positive side-effect of this is that the resulting diagrams are much less
affected by the constant-sum constraint discussed before. A negative consequence remains, however, that all
statistical rigor is lost. Nevertheless, it is not the intention of this paper to discredit the discriminantion diagrams of
Pearce and Cann (1973), Wood (1980), Shervais (1982), Meschede (1986) and others. Rather, the paper merely
explains how to perform discriminant analysis of geochemical data in a statistically more rigorous
manner.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 752--><p class="indent" >   After revisiting these historically important discrimination diagrams, an exhaustive exploration was done of all
possible linear and quadratic discriminant analyses using a dataset of 756 IABs, MORBs and OIBs. The best overall
performance was given by the Si-Ti-Sr (LDA) and Na-Nb-Sr (QDA) systems. The best LDA and QDA using only
immobile elements are the Ti-V-Sc and Ti-V-Sm systems, respectively. One of the features of the old discrimination
diagrams was a field of &#8220;not classifiable&#8221; compositions. If an unkown sample plotted outside the pre-defined fields
tectonic affinity fields, it would be labeled as &#8220;other&#8221;. The revisited discriminant analyses discussed
above do not have this feature. On the one hand, it might be considered a positive thing that the
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
method no longer &#8220;breaks down&#8221; when encountering &#8220;difficult&#8221; samples. On the other hand, one might
wonder what would happen if we were to plot a rock of very different affinity on the discrimination
diagrams. To mitigate this &#8220;garbage in, garbage out&#8221; effect, we might want to opt for a hybrid solution,
and only accept results for data that plot inside the old (hand-drawn) affinity fields, or within the
clouds of training data shown on all discrimination diagrams in this paper (Figures <a 
href="#x1-1901111">11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Ti_V_lin --></a> - <a 
href="#x1-1902222">22<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:discrimiFunc2 --></a> and <a

href="#x1-1903535">35<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:V_Ti_Sm_quad --></a>).<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 774--><p class="indent" >   Historically, discrimination diagrams and discriminant analysis have been the method of choice for geochemists
to statistically classify rocks of different environments. However, discriminant analysis is not the only &#8220;data mining&#8221;
method that can be used for this purpose. For examples, Vermeesch (in press) introduces classification trees as a
potentially very useful tool for tectonic classification. Some of the advantages of classification trees over discriminant
analysis are that the former (a) do not make any distributional assumptions, (b) can handle an unlimited
number of geochemical species, isotopic ratios or other features, while still being easily interpretable as a
two-dimensional graph and (c) can still be used if some of these features are not available. Two trees
were constructed using the same training data as in the present paper: one tree using 51 elements
and isotopic ratios and one using only 23 High Field Strength (HFS) elements and isotopic ratios.
Both trees were evaluated with the same test data used on the discrimination diagrams. The full tree
misclassifies 23 and the HFS tree 41 out of the 182 test data. Presently, the Si-Ti-Sr and Eu-Lu-Sr
LDAs, and the Na-Nb-Sr and Ti-V-Sm QDAs introduced in this paper still outperform the trees of
Vermeesch (in press). However, this is likely to change for trees created from a larger training set. Whereas
discriminant analysis does not gain much from using exceedingly large training sets, classification trees
continue to improve with growing sets of training data. Furthermore, the classification trees succeeded
in classifying all 182 test data, even for samples missing several geochemical features. None of the
discrimination diagrams achieved this. Therefore, it is probably a good idea to use a combination of both
methods.

interpolator, which is one of infinitely many functions that go through all the datapoints and, thus, have zero
bias. The solid black line is a linear regression model, which has a large bias but small variance. In this case,
the fourth order polynomial (blue) is the best predictor of future behavior. Although it has larger bias than
the 50th order polynomial (red) and larger variance than the first order polynomial (straight black line), it
minimizes the mean squared error (MSE = variance + bias<sup><span
