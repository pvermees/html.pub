\begin{letter}{Dr. A. F. Spilhaus, Jr., \\
Editor in Chief, {\it Eos}}

\opening{Dear Dr. Spilhaus,} 

I hereby submit my manuscript ``Hypothesis testing in geology'' for
publication in {\it Eos}. The paper argues against the use of
statistical hypothesis tests in the Earth Sciences.  Geologists are
increasingly relying on statistical tests for the interpretation of
their analytical data.  I believe that this is a dangerous trend,
because there are trivial yet fundamental reasons why such tests are
unsuitable for geology. During my research for this opinion piece, I
discovered that similar letters have been published in other
disciplines, such as econometrics and psychology.  I believe that a
similar warning for the Earth Sciences is long overdue. Although I am
a geochronologist by training, I used a geophysical example in my
article which might spark an interesting discussion by itself.
\\

I am looking forward to hearing back from you.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
