<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   With his 1963 paper, L.L. Sloss was one of the fathers of sequence stratigraphy, more than a decade before this
term was introduced by Vail and Mitchum (1977). On the eve of the plate tectonic revolution, Sloss described
cycles of alternating sedimentation and erosion on a continental (Sloss, 1960, 1963), and later global
(Sloss, 1976) scale. We now know that these first- and second-order stratigraphic cycles (Vail and
Mitchum, 1977) mainly are the result of the breakup and assemblage of super-continents, and of the
related periodicity in the rate of ocean spreading and the volume of mid-oceanic ridges (e.g. Flemming
and Roberts, 1973). In order to reconstruct the depositional cycles, and to correlate them across the
continents, Sloss applied a conceptually simple method, which is similar to the one that will be used in this
paper for the description of the tectonic history of China. Therefore, I term it the &#8221;Sloss method&#8221;.
<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   L.L. Sloss used isopach maps of the United States, of Canada, and of the USSR to calculate the preserved areal
extent and volume of each of the stratigraphic units of the maps. Converting these units to physical time by means
of the geological time scale, he obtained depositional time series, which he found to be remarkably similar for
the three areas studied (Sloss, 1976). Unfortunately, no isopach atlas exists that covers the entire
territory of China. Instead, I use the digitized geologic and tectonic (Fig. <a 
href="#x1-10022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:chinaslossSmallMagmatic --></a>) map at a scale of 1:5,000,000
(USGS open file reports 97-470F and 97-470C). Although we have the disadvantage of poorer data
quality, we also have advantages that were not available to Sloss. Computing power has increased
tremendously since 1976. The tools of GIS and statistical analysis prove to be very useful for our purposes.

<!--l. 145--><p class="indent" >   For the western United States, a GIS version of the geologic map (at a scale of 1:2,500,000) is available,
in a similar format as the geologic map of China (King and Beikman, 1974). A &#8221;Sloss curve&#8221; was
calculated for a rectangular area, located between 39<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">o</span></sup>N/100<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">o</span></sup>W and 49<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">o</span></sup>N/114<sup><span 
class="cmmi-7">o</span></sup>W and compared to the
curves that were based on isopach maps for the same area (Sloss, 1976). Thus, the validity of the
above proposed method could be tested. The results of this exercise are shown on Fig.<a 
href="#x1-20034">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:problems2 --></a>. For reasons
that are discussed further below, the fit is not perfect. Still, most depositional peaks are located at
the same times. Taking into account these remarks, the &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221; of Figs. <a 
href="#x1-10022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:chinaslossSmallMagmatic --></a> and <a 
href="#x1-20034">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:problems2 --></a> represents
an important simplification and abstraction of the geologic map. We will use them to <span 
class="cmti-10">compare </span>the
different tectonic zones of China, and reconstruct their history. Such analysis is reliable because all &#8221;Sloss
curves&#8221; on Fig.<a 
href="#x1-10022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:chinaslossSmallMagmatic --></a> are based on the same geologic map, using the same stratigraphic subdivisions. It
would be more dangerous to make inferences based on a <span 
class="cmti-10">single </span>&#8221;Sloss curve&#8221;, or use the method to
compare different data sets, which is what was done for the construction of Fig.<a

different data sources were used, it was necessary to re-calculate the &#8221;Sloss-curves&#8221; for identical time steps.
Not surprisingly, the height of the peaks differs between the two curves in most cases. This is especially
clear during the Paleozoic, which is especially affected by the &#8221;blanketing effect&#8221;. The important thing to
remember about this figure is that the major peaks and troughs are located at approximately the same
times. Thus, the geologic map can be used as a proxy for the isopach map.</span></div><!--tex4ht:label?: x1-20034 -->

<a 
 id="x1-3000doc"></a>
<!--l. 193--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;    The most important problem Sloss (1976) pointed out in his method was the incompleteness of the geologic
record: erosional processes progressively remove greater fractions of the rock record with time. Because the analysis
that is presented in this paper is not based on isopach maps, but on the geologic map, these problems are
aggravated and additional problems arise. <br 
class="newline" />
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">First and foremost, not only erosional processes, but also sedimentary processes obscure the more
     distant geological past. It is possible for a relatively thin cover of horizontally deposited sediments
     to completely dominate the geologic map of an area, even in cases where older formations represent
     much larger volumes and thicknesses. This &#8221;sedimentary blanketing effect&#8221; is illustrated by Fig.&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-30015">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:problems1 --></a>.
     The importance of the &#8221;blanketing effect&#8221; dramatically decreases with increasing age. Older geological
     formations are more likely to have been affected by previous stages of tectonism, which cause folding
     and tilting. These processes improve the quality of outcrop area as a proxy for sedimentary thickness
     and volume (Fig.<a 
href="#x1-30015">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:problems1 --></a>). Therefore, the &#8221;Sloss-like methodology&#8221; should be more reliable for the more
     distant past. However, there is a tradeoff with the time resolution, which generally <span 
class="cmti-10">decreases </span>with
     age. The Precambrian is only subdivided into 2 parts: Archean and Proterozoic. For this reason, the
     Precambrian has been omitted from the map of China in Fig. <a 
href="#x1-10022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:chinaslossSmallMagmatic --></a>. <br 
class="newline" />
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Sloss  included  lithological  data  in  his  analysis.  The  GIS  version  of  the  geologic  map  of  China
     distinguishes between sedimentary and magmatic rocks, but does not subdivide the sedimentary rocks.
     Lithologies obviously can provide important information regarding the tectonic setting of an area, but
     they are less easily represented by numbers that can be objectively compared. Also Sloss based his
     conclusions mostly on the numerical values of volume and preserved area. On Fig.<a 
href="#x1-10022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:chinaslossSmallMagmatic --></a>, the area under
     the &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221; covered by magmatic rocks is shaded gray.</li></ul>

&#8221;regions&#8221;. This grouping is in close agreement with the tectonic zonation of Zhang <span 
class="cmti-10">et al </span>(1984) and
Yin and Nie (1996). This section will discuss how the &#8221;Sloss Map&#8221; can provide a semi-independent
confirmation of its validity. On Fig.<a 
href="#x1-40016">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:chinazones2 --></a>, the tectonic affinities are indicated by different hatching patterns. The
hatching density further divides the tectonic groups in subgroups that are more convenient to discuss
together. It is important to note that some of the tectonic zones were assigned to a tectonic group in a
rather arbitrary way. Generally, this is the case for suture zones. For example, the Tian Shan was
considered as part of the &#8221;northern tectonic region&#8221;. However, we could also have put this range in the
Tarim-Qaidam block, because the Tian Shan contains fragments of both tectonic groups. Similarly, the
Qinling-Dabie zone was assigned to the North China block, but being the welding zone with the South
China block, it could just as well have been made part of the latter. The only &#8221;suture zone&#8221; for which
an exception was made is the vast Songpan Ganzi fold belt. A special discussion will be dedicated
to this zone, and its relationship with the surrounding tectonic blocks (section dealing with Central
China).

occured diachronously from the Carboniferous (west), until the Late Permian (east) (Yin and Nie,
1996). The Northern tectonic region recorded changes in the regional tectonic stress field, induced by
distant accretionary events. During the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, Paleozoic fold belts were reactivated
several times as complicated systems of intracontinental mountain ranges and sedimentary basins.
Although its tectonic zones have a similar (Paleozoic) tectonic history, the Northern tectonic region is
so large, that we will continue our discussion by further dividing it into an eastern and a western
part.

<!--l. 298--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;    Northeast China is part of the Mongolian accretionary fold belt, which is a collage of Ordovician to Early
Permian island arcs, blueschist-bearing assemblages, Paleozoic ophiolites, and possible microcontinental blocks
(Davis <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 2001). These tectonic settings stand out in the &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221; of Fig. <a 
href="#x1-60017">7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:northeast --></a> by the great relative
importance of magmatic lithologies, which are shaded gray. During the Late Permian and Early Triassic, the
Mongolian arc terrane was finally welded together with the North China craton along the Suolon suture (Yin and
Nie, 1996; Davis <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 2001). On the &#8221;Sloss map&#8221;, this event is represented by a subsequent absence of deposits
during the Triassic, which is probably due to the compression and mountain building that followed collision. During
the Late Triassic, the controversial Mongolo-Okhotsk ocean opened to the north of the Mongolian arc terrane.
This ocean started subducting both to the north and to the south, causing a continued importance of
magmatic rocks in the &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221; (figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-60017">7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:northeast --></a>) (Yin and Nie, 1996). During the Jurassic and the
Cretaceous, the Suolon suture was reactivated as the Yanshan fold and thrust belt, on the northern
margin of the North China block (Davis <span 
class="cmti-10">et al</span>, 1998, 2001). This will be discussed in more detail later.
Important to note here is that one of the hypotheses for the driving force behind this reactivation is the
Cretaceous closure of the Mongolo-Okhotsk ocean (Zonenshain, 1990; Yin and Nie, 1996; Davis <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 1998,
2001).

The importance of subduction processes during most of the history of this region is reflected by the large
contribution of magmatic rocks to the &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221;. During the Mesozoic large sedimentary basins formed,
whereas the Suolon suture was reactivated south of it, to form the Yanshan fold belt. The Paleogene is

<!--l. 340--><p class="indent" >   Alternatively, also the collisions that occured on the southern margin of the Asian continent (notably the
Cretaceous accretion of the Lhasa block), could have been responsible for the Yanshan compression (Graham <span 
class="cmti-10">et al</span>,
2001). Curiously, this compression was also associated with basin-forming extension in the Mongolian arc terranes
(Davis <span 
class="cmti-10">et al</span>, 2001; Graham <span 
class="cmti-10">et al</span>, 2001). Examples of such basins are the Hailar basin and the Songliao basin,
which may have been caused by Pacific back-arc extension, or by gravitational collapse of the Late
Paleozoic orogen (Graham <span 
class="cmti-10">et al</span>, 2001). This apparent paradox can be reconciled by partitioning of the
Gobi extensional province from the contractional Yinshan-Yanshan orogenic belt by escape-tectonic
strike-slip faults, such as the East Mongolian Zuunbayan fault, which would be associated with the
coeval collisions on the southern Asian and Mongolo-Okhotsk margins (Graham <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 2001). During
the Paleogene, all the &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221; of Northeast China show a dip, which could be a distant result
of the India-Eurasia collision, or alternatively, be caused by changes in the Pacific plate subduction
regime. The only &#8221;Sloss curve&#8221; in Northeast China that does show Paleogene sedimentation of any
significance is the Yitong graben, which suggests that this feature is at least that old (Tian and Du,
1987).

<a

<!--l. 363--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;    The pre-Devonian history of Northwest China is poorly understood. Several microcontinents and island arcs
were drifting around on the subducting Turkestan ocean that separated the Tarim-North China block from
Siberia-Kazakhstan (Heubeck, 2001). Between the Early and the Middle Devonian, southerly sourced clastic
sediments were deposited along the passive continental margin of North Tarim (Yin and Nie, 1996). These rocks
presently make up the southern Tian Shan; thus the latter does not really belong to the &#8221;Northern tectonic
region&#8221;. During the Carboniferous, two more components of the Tian Shan were welded to the Tarim
block: (1) the central Tian Shan block, a microcontinent with Precambrian basement; and then (2)
the northern Tian Shan and Junggar blocks, a post-Devonian arc terrane (Zhou <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 2001). The
collision of the Junggar arcs and the Devonian Altai arcs with the Tarim - North China block in the
Carboniferous - Early Permian marked the beginning of the diachronous closing of the Turkestan
ocean, which eventually led to the formation in the northeast of the Permo-Triassic fold belt. After
its formation in the Carboniferous, the Tian Shan, in a very similar way to the Yinshan-Yanshan,
would be reactivated during the Late Mesozoic and the Late Cenozoic, as a result of collisional events
that occured far to the south of the range (Dumitru <span 
class="cmti-10">et al</span>, 2001). Examples of such events are the
Jurassic Qiangtang-Tarim collision and the Cretaceous Qiangtang-Lhasa collision. Furthermore, the
Cenozoic Himalaya orogeny has caused stresses that are transferred deep into the Asian continent. They
have made the modern Tian Shan the most spectacular of all intracontinental mountain belts, with
elevations of up to 7,400m, at more than 1,000km from the suture zone (Molnar and Tapponnier,
1975).

and island arcs, that were accreted during the Paleozoic. Magmatic rocks dominate the &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221;
until the Carboniferous-Permian, which corresponds with the final closure of the Turkestan ocean and the
formation of the ancestral Tian Shan. In contrast with the Northeast (Fig.<a

magmatism. The &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221; of the fold belts all show a Triassic dip, a Jurassic high, a Cretaceous dip,
and a Cenozoic high. These reflect the repeated reactivation of this region due to ongoing collisions on the
southern margin of the Asian continent. </span></div><!--tex4ht:label?: x1-70018 -->

<!--l. 410--><p class="indent" >   The &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221; of different portions of Northwest China (Fig.<a 
href="#x1-70018">8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:northwest --></a>) share numerous characteristics with each
other, indicating a common tectonic history since the Carboniferous. The Late Paleozoic is characterized by
voluminous magmatic lithologies, which represents the subduction dominated setting of many of the
terranes of this area. From the Permian onward, magmatism ceased, in marked contrast with the
tectonic zones of northeastern China. Indeed, in the northeast the existence of the Mongolo-Okhotsk
ocean, and the proximity to the subducting Pacific Ocean, continued to generate magmas throughout
the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, which was not the case for northwest China. Another characteristic of
most zones of the &#8221;Sloss map&#8221; of Northwest China is a pronounced dip during the Triassic, which
was probably caused by mountain building that followed closure of the Turkestan ocean, with the
addition of the compressional stresses caused by the southerly Qiangtang-Tarim collision. The Jurassic
shows up as a peak in most &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221;. This could represent post-orogenic subsidence (&#8221;collapse&#8221;).
The Cretaceous is a dip again, corresponding to Late Mesozoic reactivation of the Tian Shan that
is detected by a cluster of Cretaceous apatite fission track ages (Bullen <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 2001; Dumitru <span 
class="cmti-10">et al</span>,
2001). Finally, the Cenozoic &#8221;Sloss curve&#8221; shows an increase. This is caused by a strong &#8221;blanketing
effect&#8221;, and reflects the formation of large foreland basins (e.g, Junggar, Turpan) between the different
mountain ranges (e.g., Tian Shan, Bogda Shan). The structural and stratigraphic relief between these
coexisting tectonic elements can attain several thousand meters over distances of just a few tens of
kilometers.

<a 
 id="x1-8000doc"></a>
<!--l. 439--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;    The Tarim block and the North China craton are often postulated to have behaved as a single tectonic block
since at least the early Paleozoic (e.g. Zhang <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 1984; Yin and Nie, 1996). Others have suggested that they were
separate blocks until the Permo-Triassic closure of the Turkestan ocean (Zhou and Graham, 1996a; Yang <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>,
1997). That the Tarim block and the North China craton are only connected by a very narrow strip. This &#8221;problem&#8221;
is solved by restoring <span 
class="cmsy-10">~ </span>400km of Cenozoic sinistral displacement along a controversial Altyn Tagh-Alxa-East
Mongolia fault (Yue and Liou, 1999; Yue <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 2001). In this section, we will discuss the North China
craton <span 
class="cmti-10">sensu stricto</span>, which is the eastern part of the North China-Tarim block. The North China
craton is bordered to the north by the Permo-Triassic Suolon suture, which was reactivated during the
Jurassic as the Yanshan intracontinental fold belt (Davis <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 1998, 2001). To the southwest, the North
China craton is sutured against the Qaidam block along the Qilian Shan; the suture marks a collisional
event of Devonian age. Due east of the Qilian Shan is the Qinling-Dabie Shan, which represents the
Permo-Triassic collision of the North China block with the South China block (Yin and Nie, 1996; Zhou
and Graham, 1996b). To the southeast, the North China block is offset by the sinistral Tan Lu fault
system.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 462--><p class="indent" >   Although named a &#8221;craton&#8221; (it has Archean basement), the North China tectonic group underwent substantial
internal deformation over the course of its Phanerozoic history. The &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221; of the North China craton do not
tell a simple story. Important information has been obscured by the &#8221;blanketing effect&#8221;. This is especially the case
for the Cenozoic Bohai rift basin. During the Late Triassic, this zone roughly corresponded to the
&#8221;Huabei plateau&#8221;, which was the result of continuing convergence after the collision of South China with
North China (Yin and Nie, 1996). Sediments derived from this topographic high were deposited in the
neighboring Shanxi and Ordos basins, where they are responsible for a Triassic peak in the &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221;.
This is a feature that will be seen more often in the &#8221;Sloss map&#8221; of central China (discussed below;
Fig.<a

<!--l. 477--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;    The South China block is a relatively stable craton (also called the &#8221;Yangtze craton&#8221;) that has a relatively
insensitive &#8221;Sloss curve&#8221;. In the Jiangsu- and South China fold belts, all stratigraphic ages are represented
approximately to an equal degree, with a small preference to the Quaternary due to the &#8221;blanketing effect&#8221;. The
&#8221;Sloss curves&#8221; of the western part of the South China tectonic group show a distinct peak in the Triassic.
This marks the collision of the South China block with the North China block, as will be discussed
below.

<a 
 id="x1-10000doc"></a>
<!--l. 488--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;    As was previously discussed, disagreement exists as to whether or not the Tarim block and the North China
craton were separate tectonic entities before the Permian. A similar controversy exists about the Qaidam block.
Some have suggested that it was part of the Tarim before being cut off and displaced by the Altyn Tagh fault (Zhou
and Graham 1996a; some extent also Yin and Nie, 1996), whereas others think that the two to represent separate
tectonic blocks (e.g. Zhang <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 1984). The discovery of a Middle Paleozoic suture zone in the Altyn Tagh favors
the latter point of view (Sobel and Arnaud, 1999). After the Qaidam and Tarim blocks were welded together, an
extensive, continuous, late Paleozoic - early Mesozoic Kunlun magmatic arc developed along their southern
margin. This arc died during the Triassic collision of the Tarim-Qaidam block with the Qiangtang
block.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 503--><p class="indent" >   The closure of the ocean basin that existed between the Tarim-Qaidam block and the Qiangtang block, is
marked by the abrupt ending of the (gray-shaded) magmatic area under the &#8221;Sloss curve&#8221; of the Kunlun tectonic
zone. The same is true for the Altun Shan, where magmatism ended with the closure of the ocean that existed
between Tarim and Qaidam. Due to the &#8221;blanketing effect&#8221;, little can be said about the &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221; of the
Qaidam and Tarim basins themselves. In this case, it would be particularly valuable to have access to isopach maps
such as the ones Sloss (1976) used.

<a 
 id="x1-11000doc"></a>
<!--l. 515--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;    The most representative tectonic element for this region is the Songpan-Ganzi fold belt. This tectonic zone is
characterized by a striking depositional peak in the Triassic (Fig.<a 
href="#x1-110019">9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:central --></a>). This peak can be recognized slightly less
spectacularly in the zones immediately to the south of Songpan-Ganzi (e.g., the Sichuan Basin, Sulong Shan). Sloss
(1963, 1976) was not the first person to recognize that the Triassic was a lull in continental sedimentation. It
followed immediately after the last (Variscan) stages of the assemblage of the Pangea supercontinent, and is
characterized by very low global sea level (Vail and Mitchum, 1977). Hence, the abundance of Triassic deposits in
the tectonic zones of Central China must indicate an important tectonic event. This event is the diachronous
suturing of the North and South China blocks (Zhou and Graham, 1996b). North of Songpan-Ganzi
(e.g., Altun Shan), the Triassic shows up as a low point in the &#8221;Sloss curve&#8221;. This could either be
the result of the worldwide sea level drop described above or alternatively, be caused by the same
events that caused the Triassic peak in and south of Songpan-Ganzi. Indeed, if the Triassic orogeny was
the result of northward underthrusting of the South China block under the North China block, it
seems likely that the zones north of the suture zone would be uplifted, whereas the southern zones
would flexurally subside. A modern day analogue to this would be the association on either side of
the Indus-Tsangpo suture zone of the North Indian Ganges foreland basin, and the Tibet-Qinghai
Plateau.

<!--l. 557--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;    The Qiangtang block drifted off from Gondwana some time during the Paleozoic (Yin and Harrison, 2000).
During the Triassic, the ocean that separated the Qiangtang terrane from the Asian continent started subducting
beneath it. The northern margin of the Qiangtang terrane became an active one, which is reflected in an increase of
the magmatic area under its &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221; (Fig.&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-1200110">10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:southwest --></a>). Almost immediately following the Permo-Triassic collision of
South China with North China, the Qiangtang-Indochina block was underthrusted by the amalgamated South
China and Qaidam-Tarim blocks along the Jinsha suture (Chang <span 
class="cmti-10">et al</span>, 1986; Yin and Nie, 1996; Yin and Harrison,
2000). The Songpan-Ganzi remnant ocean basin was trapped in the triangular space between the three
aforementioned blocks. The Triassic peak in the &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221; of the Qiangtang block testify of this event
(Figs.<a 
href="#x1-110019">9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:central --></a> and&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-1200110">10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:southwest --></a>). Although subduction-related magmatism stopped in the Kunlun, it continued in the
Qiangtang block, along with the approach from the south of the Gondwana-derived Lhasa block. The Lhasa
block collided with the Qiangtang block along the Banggong-Nujiang suture during the Cretaceous
(All&egrave;gre <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 1984; Dewey <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 1988; Yin and Nie, 1996; Yin and Harrisson, 2000). Whereas the
underthrusted Qiangtang block was deformed and uplifted (marked by a relative low in its &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221;),
the underthrusting Lhasa block underwent flexural subsidence and is generally characterized by a
&#8221;Sloss peak&#8221;. After the collision of the Lhasa block with the Qiangtang block, the oceanic crust that
separated the Lhasa block from the Indian subcontinent subducted beneath the Lhasa block, which
resulted in extensive magmatic activity and the development of the Gangdese batholith (All&egrave;gre <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>,
1984; Yin and Harrison, 2000). At approximately 45Ma, India finally collided with Asia along the
Indus-Tsangpo suture (Le Pichon <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 1992). This led to the intensely studied, but poorly understood
Himalaya-Tibet orogeny. The Tibet-Qinghai Plateau is believed to have resulted mainly from this final collision,
although it has been suggested that a pre-existing plateau formed after the Kunlun-Qiangtang collision
(Murphy <span 
class="cmti-10">et al</span>, 1997). The present day Tibet-Qinghai Plateau comprises the Lhasa terrane, the Qiangtang
terrane, and to some extent the Kunlun-Qaidam-Qilian Shan tectonic group. At the same time, the
Himalaya-Tibet orogeny reactivated many of the tectonic zones and groups that have been discussed in previous
paragraphs. This is the case for the Tian Shan and the Altai, but also for the Altun Shan, which appear
to have acted as a zone of weakness that became the preferred locus for the continental-scale Altyn
Tagh sinistral strike-slip fault. The Kunlun, Xianshui-He, and Red River faults roughly follow the
Kunlun-Anyemaqen, Jinsha, and Banggong-Nujiang sutures, respectively (Tapponnier <span 
class="cmti-10">et al.</span>, 2001).
Thus, fault reactivation seems to be a major factor in the deformation of the Chinese tectonic &#8221;jigsaw
puzzle&#8221;. The translation of this in terms of &#8221;Sloss curves&#8221; is a trivial one: topographic depressions
cause Cenozoic peaks, whereas areas of high relief show a dip in the Cenozoic &#8221;Sloss curve&#8221;. These
signatures can be seen all over China, and perhaps even affect the Pacific margin (e.g. Jolivet <span 
class="cmti-10">et al</span>,
1990).

<!--l. 631--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;    I have developed a method for representing a two-dimensional geologic map by a one-dimensional depositional
time series, similar to the way L.L.Sloss represented the geologic maps of North America and eastern Europe
(Sloss, 1976). Going one step further, the geologic map and the tectonic map of China were united
into one &#8221;Sloss map&#8221;. Despite limitations and assumptions of the method, the &#8221;Sloss map&#8221; proves
useful for recognizing the most important tectonic events of Phanerozoic China, and for delimiting
tectonic regions, which can comprise multiple tectonic zones. The Permian-Triassic North China - South
China collision and the Cenozoic India - Eurasia collision stand out especially clearly. Also, difference
between stable cratons and tectonically more sensitive accretionary fold belts can easily be recognized.
<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 645--><p class="indent" >   Major improvements could be made with the incorporation of isopach maps, rather than ordinary geologic maps.
Other welcome changes would be increased time resolution, and the addition of more lithological parameters to the
geologic map. If all these conditions were fulfilled, it might be possible to fully automate the interpretation of the
&#8221;Sloss map&#8221; by means of a statistical correlation analysis. If extended to other continents, the &#8221;Sloss analysis&#8221; could
prove to be as useful in tracing and describing the <span 
class="cmti-10">breakup </span>of continents, as it is with continental <span 
class="cmti-10">accretion</span>, which I
have demonstrated in this paper with China&#8217;s history of amalgamation. The first places to examine in the case of
China would be Gondwana, and the southern margin of the Tethys. Indeed, most of the tectonic blocks of Fig.<a 
href="#x1-10022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:chinaslossSmallMagmatic --></a>
originally drifted off from continental areas now consituting India and Australia (&#350;eng&ouml;r and Natal&#8217;in, 1996).
The methodology described in this paper might prove to be a good first-order way of detecting such
associations.<br

<!--l. 662--><p class="indent" >   Another application of the &#8221;Sloss method&#8221; in its present form would be the study of orogenic terranes. If
geologic maps exist in a GIS form, the &#8221;Sloss curve&#8221; derived from the geologic map could be used as a proxy for
the isopach map, as was suggested in Fig.<a 
href="#x1-20034">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:problems2 --></a>. Doing this may yield insight in the evolution of rates of
deposition until the time of collision, which is important for understanding the mechanisms of mountain
building.
