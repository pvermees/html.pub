is a free and open substitute for Kenneth Ludwig's popular 
Isoplot add-in to Microsoft Excel. The program includes functions for 
U-Pb, Pb-Pb, <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, 
Lu-Hf, Re-Os, U-Th-He, fission track and U-series disequilibrium dating.
<tt>IsoplotR</tt> is programmed in <tt>R</tt> and can be run (1) online,
via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that runs in a 
web browser on any internet-connected device; (2) offline,
natively running the GUI on any computer that has <tt>R</tt> 
installed on it; and (3) from the command line, which allows
<tt>IsoplotR</tt> to be extended and incorporated into automation scripts.

<a href="cosmocalc"><tt>CosmoCalc</tt></a> is an Excel add-in (<tt>.xla</tt>) 
for cosmogenic nuclide calculations. The program scales production rates for 
<sup>10</sup>Be, <sup>26</sup>Al, <sup>21</sup>Ne, <sup>3</sup>He and <sup>14</sup>C 
within a self-consistent framework of calibration sites; calculates exposure ages, 
erosion rates and burial ages; includes a forward modelling calculator, 
and generates </sup>21</sup>Ne/<sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al/<sup>10</sup>Be 
two-nuclide diagrams.

<a href="radialplotter"><tt>RadialPlotter</tt></a> is a user-friendly application for generating radial plots. 
It has the following advantages over existing programs such as Trackkey or MacTrack. 
(1) The main purpose of the program is to produce radial plots. Therefore, radial plot 
functions are not buried deep inside the menu structure and the interface is very straightforward. 
(2) RadialPlotter was written in Java (version 6) and is, therefore, perfectly platform independent. 
(3) In addition to fission track radial plots, RadialPlotter also offers the possibility to generate 
radial plots for luminescence dating, or any other kind of data such as (U-Th)/He or U-Pb ages.

radial plots and mixture models of (detrital) age distributions. The program is based on, 
and in fact offers exactly the same functionality as&nbsp;<tt>RadialPlotter</tt> 
albeit with a different set of pre-loaded preferences.

<a href="helioplot"><tt>HelioPlot</tt></a> implements the following functionality. 
(1) Plots (U-Th)/He and (U-Th-Sm)/He data on ternary diagrams and logratio plots. 
(2) Calculates central ages, which are the most accurate estimators of average age. 
(3) Computes 95% confidence intervals using a deterministic Bayesian algorithm. 
(4) Calculates MSWDs indicating goodness of fit by a single logistic normal population. 
(5) Saves the output in image (.png) or vector (.pdf) formats.

is an <tt>R</tt> package for statistical provenance analysis, which 
includes functionality for adaptive kernel density
estimation, multidimensional scaling (MDS), generalised procrustes analysis
and individual differences scaling of distributional (e.g., zircon U-Pb ages) 
and compositional (e.g., heavy mineral) datasets using a variety of 
dissimilarity measures. Also included are tools to plot 
compositional data on ternary diagrams, to
calculate the sample size required for specified levels of statistical
precision, and to assess the effects of hydraulic sorting on detrital
compositions. Alternatively, <a href="mudisc">
<tt>MuDiSc</tt></a> is a Matlab GUI for MDS analysis of distributional 
datasets only.

<a href="resochronometer"><tt>resochronometer</tt></a>
is a <tt>Javascript</tt> based web-application for in-situ U-Th-He geochronology
that can be run both on- and offline. It implements two algorithms:
(1) an 'absolute' dating method that uses the U, Th, (Sm, ) and He concentrations
in moles per unit volume; and (2) a 'pairwise' dating method that ties the
relative amounts of U, Th, (Sm, ) and He for the sample to those of a 
standard of known U-Th-(Sm-)He age. The standard measurements are grouped
in a &kappa; calibration constant, as described by Evans et al. (JAAMS, 2015).

is a crowd-sourcing app for fission track dating. It can be run in a
web browser, on your computer, tablet or smartphone. It is based on
the notion that human observers are better at pattern recognition than
computers, and that groups of human observers are better at counting
items than individual observers. Please give the app a spin and if you
register with your email address (optional), we will notify you of and
acknowledge you in any publication resulting from your work.</td>
