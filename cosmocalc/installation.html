Over the years, various iterations of Microsoft Excel have made it more
difficult to install third party add-ins. The original installation instructions
of <tt>CosmoCalc</tt> were pretty straightforward, as explained in the 
<A HREF="manual">manual</A>. For later versions of Excel, a few additional steps
may be required:

<ol>
<li>Visit <tt>http://cosmocalc.london-geochron.com</tt> and download <tt>CosmoCalc.xlam</tt>.
PC users may find that Windows changes the extension of this file to <tt>.xls</tt>.
If this happens, then rename it back to <tt>.xlam</tt>.
</li>
<li> Enable macros in the Trust Center: <tt>File</tt> &#8594; <tt>Options</tt> &#8594;

 and enable macros.
</li>
<li> Enable Developer tools: <tt>File</tt> &#8594; <tt>Options</tt> &#8596;
