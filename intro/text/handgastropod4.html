The matrix is extremely fine grained and is described as
microcystalline micrite.  Individual skeletal fragments are touching
each other and micrite has been deposited in any grain pore spaces.
This rock would classify as a gastropod packstone under Dunham's
classification because it contains mud but is grain supported.  Under
Folk's classification this rock would be called a biomicrite.  The
rock was lithified in a low energy environment, very oxygenated,
marine conditions of normal salinity.  Low energy levels are evident
due to the presence of micrite, which would have been washed away in
higher energy environments.
