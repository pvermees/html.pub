<h3>Relief</h3>

There is a simple method of testing to see whether a mineral has a
higher or lower relief than an adjacent mineral or the canada balsam
used to attach the cover slip. This is called the Becke Line test.

<p></p>
Take a look at this video which is a close up of a mineral in contact
with canada balsam, in PPL. Use medium power magnification with the
sub-stage diaphragm almost closed.

<p></p>
As the mineral comes into focus a thin, bright line of light can be
seen around the edge of the mineral. Slowly over-focus and under-focus
and you will see the line moving into the mineral and/or into the
canada balsam.

As the microscope tube is racked down the Becke line moves towards the
medium with the lowest relief.
