Using this photograph and the previous ones, you should be able to
note the size of the allochems and the precentage they cover in thin
section.  In terms of classifying this rock, the matrix is made of
micrite and the allochems are touching each other.  Therefore, under
Dunham's classification, this would be called a skeletal packstone.
The environment of deposition should be low energy, due to the
presence of micrite and the complete nature of the gastropod shells.
Gastropods are frequently found in a low energy, protected
environment, perhaps a lagoon or behind a sea barrier.
