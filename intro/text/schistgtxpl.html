This garnet provides a feast of interesting features.  Firstly, we
notice the garnet is mostly associated with the mafic layers.  This is
because garnet is an Fe-Al silicate, and mafic layers are rich in
these components and therefore provide a source of material for garnet
growth.  We can also see the garnet has inclusions within it.  The
garnet has grown around and incorporated those minerals.  A large
metamorphic mineral surrounded by finer grained minerals is called a
porphyroblast.  But in this case, when it contains mineral inclusions,
it is called a poikiloblast.  The poikiloblast isolates and protects
the inclusions from recrystallising and can therefore provide
information about the original rock mineralogy and fabrics/textures
present.  Metamorphic rocks often have enjoyed successive metamorphic
and/or deformational events, which may partially or wholly overprint
the pre-existing minerals and textures.  By careful observation, we
can normally determine the deformational and metamorphic history of
the rock.
