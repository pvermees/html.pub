<h3>Cleavage</h3>

Cleavage is the splitting or breaking of a crystal along planar
surfaces which are determined by the crystal structure and bond
strengths in the mineral.

<p></p>
There can be more than one cleavage in hand-specimen with minerals
often displaying one, two or three cleavages.

<p></p>
The quality of cleavage is defined as perfect, strong or poor.  Also
taken into consideration are the angles two or more cleavages make
with each other such as amphibole 120<sup>o</sup> or pyroxene
90<sup>o</sup>.

Muscovite is said to have a perfect cleavage in one direction
