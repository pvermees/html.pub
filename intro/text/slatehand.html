This rock is a fine grained slate with well developed slaty cleavage.
It also has white acicular needles of andalusite and occasionally you
can see them in cross-section when they have a prismatic shape.  Try
to determine the relationship between the andalusite crystals and the
slaty cleavage.  This will give you an indication of the metamorphic
events that have affected these rocks and also the timing of these
events.
