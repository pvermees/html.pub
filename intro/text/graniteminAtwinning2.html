Mineral A is colourless and non-pleochroic. Crystals are subhedral and do not show cleavage in PPL. It
has very low relief. The dusty or turbid appearance is due to late stage alteration. In cross-polar light
the mineral shows weak birefringence of 1st order greys and lamellar twinning is obvious.

When you see lamellar twinning it is useful to use the Michel Levy
test to help identify this mineral.  Measure the angle between no
extinction (as shown in the photograph) and complete extinction of one
set of twins.  The more measurements taken the more accurate your
answer will be.
