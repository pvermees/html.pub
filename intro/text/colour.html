<h1>Colour</h1> 

<p></p>
One of the first things you notice when looking down a microscope is
the colour of the minerals, either in plane polarised light or crossed
polarised light. There is a gamut of colours ranging from colourless
quartz and feldspars, through the greens of chlorite and amphiboles
to, the browns of biotite. There are also completely black minerals
called opaques.

Obviously colour is an important factor in the identification
of minerals but many minerals have a variable chemical composition
which can influence the colour of the mineral. Colour should therefore
be used in conjunction with other properties to determine the name of
the mineral.
