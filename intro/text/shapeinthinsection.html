<h3>Shape</h3>

The shape of a mineral is governed by its crystal structure and is
called its habit.  There are several habits a mineral might develop.

<p></p>
If the length of the crystal is longer than its width it is called
prismatic (eg. olivine), acicular (eg. tourmaline) or
bladed. (eg. kyanite).

<p></p>
If the length is shorter than its width it is described as tabular
(eg. feldspar) or platy (eg. biotite).

<p></p>
Finally, if its length is approximately the same as its width we call
it equant.
