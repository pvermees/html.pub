You now need to identify the minerals A, B, C, and D
<p></p>
Mineral A is a common rock forming which you are already familiar with
In PPL, it is colourless, shows no pleochroism,
has low relief, and lacks cleavage but shows some fracture.
The surface looks spotted because of fluid inclusions, which are bubbles
of fluid trapped during mineral growth.
<p></p>
In XPL, the birefringence colours are first order gray with unit extinction,
indicating that this grain comes from an igneous source.
<p></p>
This is quartz, which is the most abundant mineral in this rock.
Quartz does not necessarily occur in exactly this form, as shown next.
