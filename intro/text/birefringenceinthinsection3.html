<h3>Birefringence</h3>

Look at these muscovite crystals and note that they exhibit many
different colours depending on their orientation.

<p></p>
To overcome this problem you need to look at their maximum
birefringence.
 
<p></p>
In the photograph you can see muscovite shows colours varying from
lower 2nd order greens and yellows, up to higher 2nd order blues.

Muscovite has a maximum birefringence in the upper 2nd order.
