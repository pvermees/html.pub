writing a petrogenesis and suggesting a possible location where this type of rock

This rock is an intrusive igneous rock with biotite and amphibole. There
are two distinct crystal sizes in this rock and it is therefore possible this
rock underwent two stages of cooling. A typical locality would be above a subduction
zone e.g. the Andes.

This rock is actually from Shap in the English Lake District and was intruded at the
end of the Caledonian Orogeny.
