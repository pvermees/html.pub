Fine grained rocks are quite difficult to identify because individual crystals in
matrix are not visible, but you know this rock is

<ul>
<li> Dark coloured
<li> Highly mafic
<li> Basic
<li> Porphyritic with clinopyroxene and Olivine phenocrysts
</ul>

Can you name this rock?

Lastly try to write a petrogenesis. Remember to consider everything you have
seen. Think about which minerals are present and how they could have formed.
Think about the igenous processes that could have created this rock and the
fabrics within it. Finally think of a locality and tectonic setting where you 
might find this kind of rock.
