<h3>Streak</h3>

If you were to scratch the mineral across an abrasive surface such as
an unglazed porcelain tile, it would leave a fine deposit behind. The
colour of this deposit is known as the streak.

Hematite can be coloured black, red or brown in hand-specimen but
always shows a reddish-brown streak.
