Now you should move on to the minerals that make up this
rock. This is quite hard with fine-grained rocks so first
look at the phenocrysts. Remember:

<ul>
<li> Colour
<li> Transparency
<li> Habit/crystal form
<li> Cleavage
<li> Streak (if possible)
<li> Hardness (if possible)
<li> Specific gravity (if possible)
</ul>
