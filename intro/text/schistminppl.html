Look carefully at this photomicrograph in PPL.  Six minerals
are labeled A to F, and some of their key properties listed below.

<ul>
<li>
Mineral A shows straw to brown pleochroism, one strong cleavage, and
is straight-sided with ragged edges (tabular habit).  Pleochroic
haloes are present which result from radioactive decay in the crystal
structure.

<li>
Mineral B is colourless, has fibrous habit, and moderately high relief
with one cleavage normal to the C-axis.

<li>
Mineral C is also colourless but with a very high relief.  It has no
cleavage but is fractured.

<li>
Mineral D is colourless with no cleavage and very low relief

<li>
Mineral E is colourless. it has low relief and is non-pleochroic.
Cleavage is not visible in PPL. Furthermore, this mineral has a
'cloudy' appearance which is due to chemical breakdown forming sericite.

<li>
Mineral F is opaque in PPL and XPL.
</ul>
