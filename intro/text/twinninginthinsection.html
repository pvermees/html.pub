<h3>Twinning</h3>

The mineral labelled A in the photograph is a feldspar and although
the two halves of the mineral look different colours, it is all one
crystal.  The mineral is displaying twinning which is a common feature
in feldspars and many other minerals.

<p></p>
A twinned crystal results from the crystal lattice being orientated in
different directions.  Different geometric relationships between the
lattices produces different styles of twins.  This is known as the
twin laws.

<p></p>
Often the relationship between the twins is symmetrical and can be
either rotational or a reflection symmetry.

<p></p>
Twinning in feldspars is very distinctive and is used as a diagnostic
feature to identify the particular feldspar.
