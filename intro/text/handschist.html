This hand specimen clearly shows compositional variation, i.e.  dark
layers and lighter layers alternating throughout the rock.  The dark
bands are composed of mafic minerals such as biotite and garnet and
the lighter bands are mainly made of quartz and feldspar. When writing
your opening statement, you must consider the grain size, the overall
colour and the larger porphyroblasts of garnet up to 2mm in size and
of course the compositional layering.
