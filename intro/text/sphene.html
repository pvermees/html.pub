The mineral in the lower left part of the picture is a new mineral.
It has extremely high relief It is euhedral and has a pale brown body
colour in ppl and is occasionally pleochroic.  In xpl, the
birefringence varies with composition but is generally high order
white. It is one of very few minerals with comparable birefringence to
the carbonate mineral. Cleavage is not parallel to the crystal sides
and extinction may not be complete.  But in this case, as in most
diamond shaped sections, extinction is symmetric.

This is sphene, which is a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks,
especially granitoids.
