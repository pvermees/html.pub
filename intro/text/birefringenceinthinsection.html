<h3>Birefringence</h3>

Mineralogist and petrologists use both plane-polarised light (PPL) and
cross-polarised light (XPL) to identify the mineral they are looking
at. You need to use the analyser on your microscope to do this.

When the analyser is inserted you will immediately notice the multiple
colours in the thin-section. In XPL these colours are known as the
birefringence colours, often shortened to birefringence.
