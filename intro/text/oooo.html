In the centre if this photograph is an ooid.  These are concentric
spherical grains generally less than 2mm in diameter.  It is important
that you consider what material is forming the nuclei.  Look at
several different ooids to determine the nuclei compontent.  Are the
grains composing the nuclei texturally and compositionally mature?
How do ooids form, where would you find them today?  What does it tell
about the environment of deposition of the rock.  Note the average
size of the ooids and the percentage of ooids within this rock.
