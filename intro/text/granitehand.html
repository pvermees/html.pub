When preparing a hand-specimen description you should follow the same structured approach as you did for the 
thin-section description.

<p></p> First, start with an introduction

<p></p> Then describe each of the individual minerals, texture and
relationships of texture and mineraology (if any).

<p></p> Modal analysis followed by naming the rock.

<p></p>Complete the description with a petrogenesis.
