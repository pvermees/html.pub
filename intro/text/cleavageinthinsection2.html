<h3>Cleavage</h3>

This photograph shows an amphibole. Note how the surface of the
amphibole is divided up by a series of thin lines.  There appear to be
two sets of lines.

These lines are known as cleavage and the amphibole has two strong
cleavages.

Some minerals have one perfect cleavage such as biotite whereas others
have two, or even three cleavages such as calcite.
