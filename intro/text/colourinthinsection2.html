<h3>Colour</h3>

Look at biotite in PPL, initially it is a light pale-brown
colour. This is described as its body-colour

<p></p>
Note that as you turn the stage of the microscope the biotite colour
changes to a dark-brown colour. This property is called pleochroism
and is due to the path light takes through the mineral.

<p></p>
Some minerals are strongly pleochroic, others are only weakly
pleochroic and some are not pleochroic at all.

<p></p>
Other minerals in the field of view are quartz and feldspar. Note they
are colourless and are not pleochroic.
