Mineral A is colourless and non-pleochroic. Crystals are subhedral and do not show cleavage in PPL. It
has very low relief. The dusty or turbid appearance is due to late stage alteration. In cross-polar light
the mineral shows weak birefringence of 1st order greys and lamellar twinning is obvious. They show
lamellar twinning (with a Michel Levy angle of about 18<sup>o</sup>)

In this view you can see that  the mineral is also zoned. This is oscillary zoning and is 
due to a change in composition as the mineral grows.
