This is a non-clastic sedimentary rock, essentially composed of
allochemical components such as gastropods, bivalves and
brachiopods. Some of these allochems are up to 7 mm in length and form
helicoid spirals and are filled with a buff coloured mineral, which is
too fine grained to be resolvable with the naked eye.  The margins of
the gastropods are often a darker brown to black in colour.  Some
gastropods are filled with a buff coloured and very light brown
colour.  In thin section such dual infilling of gastropods is termed
geopetal structure and is used as a way-up indicator.
