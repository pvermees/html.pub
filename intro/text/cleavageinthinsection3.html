<h3>Cleavage</h3>

This photograph shows a close-up view of a pyroxene. Notice the angle at which
the two cleavages intersect. Pyroxenes have two cleavages intersecting at approximately
93<sup>o</sup>.

Look back to the photograph of the amphibole and compare the cleavage angles with those
of pyroxene crystals, they are distinctly different.
