<h3>Extinction</h3>

The photograph opposite shows a platy biotite crystal in XPL with a
strong parallel cleavage displayed.

As the microscope stage is rotated anticlockwise, the biotite goes
into extinction and shows the typical 'speckled' appearance known as
twinkling.

Note that the exinction angle is not quite parallel to the cleavage
direction.
