<h3>Relief</h3>

Look at this garnet in PPL. Notice how it appears to stand out against
the surrounding minerals.

<p></p>
This is known as relief and bcause it 'stands out' garnet is said to
have high relief.

<p></p>
Relief is caused by light rays travelling slower through a mineral
compared with the surrounding minerals producing an illusion of
thickness.

<p></p>
The minerals surrounding the garnet have low relief and biotite (the
brown mineral in PPL) is said to have moderate relief.
