As you can see both thin-section and hand-specimen descriptions follow the same basic
structure.

<ul>
<li>Introduction
<li>Description of the minerals (including matrix if present)
<li>Modal estimate
<li>Name of the rock
<li>Petrogenesis
</ul>

If you are not able to identify a mineral, describe its in detail and possibly
even sketch it and add annotation.

In an exam situation it is important that you have observed and described the mineral,
even if you cannot name it, at least the examiner knows that you have seen it and
will award marks for your description.
