<h3>Opening statement</h3>

This is a clastic sedimentary rock made of medium-grained sands (+0.5mm).
It is clast-supported, well sorted and does not develop a fabric.
The clasts are sub-angular to sub-rounded with quite a good sphericity.
They are tightly packed and are generally composed of a colourless mineral (A).

<h3>Mineralogy</h3>

You have identified most of the mineralogy and know that quartz is the most
abundant mineral with lesser amounts of alkali feldspar (microcline), plagioclase
feldspar, calcite, haematite, and rare lithic fragments.

The grain shape, textural maturity and overall colour of this thin section gives
us clues to the environment of deposition.

<h3>Environment of Deposition</h3>

Compositionally, this rock consists of 90% quartz, 5% alkali feldspar,
3% calcite cement, and 2% plagioclase, haematite, and lithic
fragments.  It consists of well sorted and well rounded grains and is
therefore classified as a mature sandstone.  Often grains,
particularly quartz, are coated with haematite, indicating a
subaerial, oxidising depositional environment.  Considering that the
quartz is derived from 2 different source areas containing granitic
and metamorphic rocks. Combined with the roundedness of the grains and
the textural maturity, this all indicates that this sediment was
wind-blown in a desert environment. This is an aeolian sandstone.
