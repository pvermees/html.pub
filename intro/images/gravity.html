<h3>Specific gravity</h3>

Specific gravity (or density) is the ratio of the mass of a mineral
compared to the mass of an equal volume of water, measured in
g/cm<sup>-1</sup>.

Specific gravity is not very practical in the field, except in
relative terms where we can actually feel (by weight) that one mineral
or rock is heavier than another.
