<h3>Directions for describing carbonate sedimentary rocks</h3>

The three most important components when describing carbonate rocks are:

<ol>
<li>Allochemical components: these include oods, bioclasts, pelods, intraclasts, and oncoids.
They are accumulations of carbonate material that have formed within the basin of deposition;

<li> Microcrystalline calcite or micrite (also known as lime-mud). Micrite is less than 
5 microns (&mu;m) in diameter and much of it is precipitated from sea water or abraded from
shells;

<li> Sparry calcite (sparite or spar) which refers to carbonate crystals greater than
5 microns (&mu;m). This is usually a coarse pore filling cement.
</ol>

When you have determined which of these components are present in the thin-section you can
begin your description.

<p></p>
A brief introduction stating the type of rock and what allochems are present should be followed
by a complete description of each allochem in detail. This is followed by details of micrite
or sparite between the grains.

<p></p>
Finally the rock is classified according to Dunham's or Folk's classification and the interpretation
of the environment of deposition should be completed.
