<h3>Full thin section description</h3>

This is a coarse grained, crystalline, intrusive igneous mainly composed of felsic minerals and is light in colour.

<h4>Mineralogy</h4>

Mineral A is colourless and non-pleochroic. Crystals are subhedral and
do not show cleavage and it has a very low relief. The dusty or turbid
texture is due to late stage alteration.  In cross-polar light the
mineral shows weak birefringence to 1st order greys. The mineral has
lamellar twinning (with a Michel Levy angle of about 18<sup>o</sup>
making it albite) and oscillatory zoning. Extinction is oblique.
Mineral A is plagioclase feldspar (albite) and makes up 20% of this
rock.

Mineral B is colourless and non-pleochroic. Crystals are anhedral and
do not show cleavage and has a very low relief. In cross-polar light
it shows weak birefringence to 1st order greys. It is not twinned and
some crystals show undulose extinction.  Mineral B is quartz and makes
up 45% of this rock.

Mineral C is colourless and non-pleochroic. Crystals are anhedral,
cleavage is not visible and it has a very low relief.  In cross-polar
light it shows weak birefringence to 1st order greys with an inclined
extinction.  Mineral C is perthitic alkali feldspar and makes up 30%
of this rock.

Mineral D is "straw" brown in colour and is strongly
pleochroic. Crystals have a platy habit and are generally
subhedral. One perfect cleavage is visible and it has a moderate
relief.  In XPL it shows a moderate birefringence up to the 2nd order
colours.  Twinning is not visible and extinction is
parallel. Pleochroic haloes are present.  Mineral D is biotite and
makes up 5% of this rock.

<h4>Name</h4>

This rock has the essential minerals of quartz, alkali feldspar,
plagioclase feldspar (albite) and biotite making this rock a granite.

<h4>Petrogenesis</h4>

The colour index (Leucocratic) and the presence of hydrous biotite
indicate the magma that produced this rock underwent some degree of
evolution before it solidified. The coarse grain size indicates that
this rock is plutonic and would have cooled slowly at depth.  The
plagioclase shows signs of late stage alteration and is altering to
sericite. Biotite is also slightly altered in some crystals forming
chlorite.  This rock would be associated with a destructive plate
margin near a subduction zone such as the Andes.
