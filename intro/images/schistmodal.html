<h3>Modal analysis</h3>

The modal estimate is a visual estimate of the proportions of
individual minerals in the rock e.g.  a rock might have 5% feldspar,
15% chlorite, 30% muscovite, 45% quartz and 5% opaques.
<p></p>
Possibly one of the easiest ways to estimate the abundance of minerals
present is to work out a relative estimate. There is a small
percentage of feldspar and opaques but vastly more quartz. There is
less chlorite than there is muscovite.
<p></p>
Once you have organised your 'relative' scale you can then attribute
percentages. Once this is complete you can name your rock.
<p></p>
Another method is to draw a grid over the thin-section and work out
which is the dominant mineral in each block. Count up the blocks and
you will have your answer. The more blocks you have the more accurate
your estimate will be.

<p></p>
Feldspar 30%<br>
Quartz   25%<br>
Biotite	15%<br>
Garnet 15%<br>
Sillimanite 10%<br>
Opaques 5%<br>
Total 100%

<p></p>
Now you can name the rock a: sill-ga-bi-qtz-feldspar schist

<p></p>
You now have enough information to start your petrogenesis and
deformation history.
