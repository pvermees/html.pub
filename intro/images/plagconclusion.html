This is a coarse grained, crystalline, intrusive igneous rock. It is
mostly composed of felsic minerals and is therefore generally light in
colour.

Mineral A is colourless and is not pleochroic. Crystals are subhedral,
do not show cleavage, have a low relief and a dusty or turbid
appearance due to late stage alteration.  In cross-polar light mineral
A shows weak birefringence to 1st order greys. It shows lamellar
twinning, oscillatory zoning, oblique extinction and a Michel Levy
angle of about 18<sup>o</sup>

That is mineral A described and identified and you now need to concentrate on mineral B.
