<h3>Hardness</h3>

Another property to consider is the hardness of the
minerals. Mineralogists use the Mohs scale of hardness.  The scale is
based on the ability of one mineral to scratch another.  The order of
hardness is as follows:

<ol>
<li>Talc - softest
<li>Gypsum
<li>Calcite
<li>Fluorite
<li>Apatite
<li>Orthoclase 
<li>Quartz
<li>Topaz
<li>Corundum 
<li>Diamond - hardest
</ol>

Calcite will scratch gypsum and is therefore harder and placed further
down the scale of hardness.  If there is an unknown mineral its
hardness can be determined by testing it against the hardness of other
minerals.  For example, if its hardness is equal to apatite (5) it
will be scratched by orthoclase (6), but will not be scratched by
fluorite (4).

Work out mineral A's hardness by using Mohs scale of hardness.

You might not have access to a hardness kit in the field so it is
useful to know the hardness of some everyday objects:

fingernails = 2 <br>
metal knife =  6<br>
glass = 5
