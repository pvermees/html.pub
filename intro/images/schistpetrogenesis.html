<h3>Petrogenesis and deformation history</h3>

You need to look at the information gathered so far and try to
determine how the rock was developed.
<p></p>
Due to the abundance of hydrous minerals rich in potassium, iron,
aluminium and magnesium you can deduce that the protolith (original
rock) of this rock was a mud rich pelite. The presence of sillimanite
indicates that this rock has reached the sillimanite zone of Barrovian
regional metamorphism (high temperature, medium to high pressure)
typical of an orogenic event.
<p></p> It appears that this sample has undergone one major
metamorphic and deformational event (M1, D1) creating a schistosity
(S1).
<p></p>
There is no evidence of retrograde metamorphism so you can therefore
deduce that this rock was exhumed quite quickly (in geological terms)
and no water was re-introduced into the system. However, there is a
small amount of sericite present which indicates some chemical
breakdown of the feldspars.
<p></p>
The rock has undergone regional metamorphism with the highest
temperature Barrovian index mineral being sillimanite and was probably
formed from a mud-rich protolith in a continent-continent collision
zone of an orogeny.  It has undergone high temperature, medium
pressure metamorphism.
