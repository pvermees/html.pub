<h3>igneous practicals</h3>

The Igneous section is  split into four practicals, each with a thin-section and and a hand specimen.
<ul>
<li>Practical A is interactive and consists of a series of questions. Answer the questions and see how a description is constructed.
<li>Practical B asks the same questions but you get much less help in constructing the descriptions.
<li>Practical C consists of only the photographs. See if you can write your own descriptions.
<li>Practical D you are on your own.  Write your description and hand it in to receive feedback.
</ul>
As you progress through the questions you wil see a description (based
on your answers) being produced in the bottom left hand corner of the
screen. On a separate sheet of paper, write down the text that appears
in the bottom left corner as you go.
