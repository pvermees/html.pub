<I>Introductory statement</I>

<P></P>
This rock is a fine to medium grained, porphyroblastic rock with a
strongly developed schistosity resulting from the prefered orientation
of the phyllosilicate minerals"

<I>Now you need to elaborate on the mineralogy</I>

<P></P>
Porphyroblasts of garnet, up to 4mm are found within a fine to medium
grained matrix which is "crudely" separated into biotite rich
lepidoblastic layers and quartz and feldspar rich granoblastic
layers. The fibrous mineral sillimanite is growing epitaxially from
biotite. Late stage alteration of feldspar to sericite is also
visible.

<p></p> Mineral A has straw to brown pleochroism, one strong cleavage,
and is straight-sided with ragged edges (tabular habit). Pleochroic
haloes are present which result from radioactive damage to the crystal
structure.<br>
This mineral has strong birefringence  in XPL, up to 2nd order red.
Extinction is parallel to straight crystal sides. This is BIOTITE

<p></p> Mineral B is colourless, has a fibrous habit, with fairly high
relief and one cleavage normal to the C-axis.<br>
It has moderate birefringence, 2nd order blue with parallel
extinction. This is SILLIMANITE

<p></p> Mineral C is colourless with no cleavage and high relief. This
mineral is isotropic in XPL. This is GARNET

<p></p>
Mineral D is colourless with no cleavage and very low relief. This
mineral has low birefringence, 1st order greys and shows undulose
extinction. This is QUARTZ

<p></p>
Mineral E is also colourless. It has low relief and is
non-pleochroic. Cleavage is not visible in PPL. This mineral also has
a cloudy or dirty look which is due to its chemical breakdown to
sericite. This mineral has low birefringence, 1st order
greys. Lamellar twinning is also present. This is PLAGIOCLASE FELDSPAR

<p></p>
Mineral F is opaque in both PPL and XPL. These are OPAQUES
