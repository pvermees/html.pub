Welcome to the metamorphic practicals.

<p></p>
Follow the same general approach to writing descriptions of
metamorphic rocks and thin-sections as you have been taught so far.

<p></p>
Firstly start with an introduction, an opening statement describing
the overall features of the specimen, such as crystal size, colour,
texture and any other properties that are prominent.

<p></p>
Describe the mineralogy, the minerals present, and some of their
optical properties such as colour, shape and size.

<p></p>
Describe the fabrics/textures visible and then consider the
relationships of the textures to the mineralogy.

<p></p>
Estimate the proportion (%) of the minerals present, the modal
estimate.  Then, you can name the rock and complete your description
by describing the process that formed the rock, that is, the
petrogenesis.  It is important to remember that when naming a
metamorphic rock you start with the least abundant mineral first, so
that a bi-garnet-muscovite-qtz-plag-schist means that biotite is
lowest in abundance and plagioclase is the most abundant.

<p></p>
The following series of questions will help you write your opening
statement.
