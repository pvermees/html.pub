      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;can
recieve a or several Noble prizes in economy , physics </div>
      <div>if&nbsp;you like problems in the letter , because many
problems are new and deep , I hope that you can find them when you read
it severiously .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
According to me , there are 5 prizes in the articles about economy , 3
prizes in physics ( altogether more than ten persons )</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
think , Noble prizes&nbsp;should be divided into nature science prize
and society scienty prize , instead of all present prizes including
peace prize&nbsp;; And there are not many best problems in nature
science and society scienty includes many branchs besides economy ,
each has many theories which need be given prizes
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another ,&nbsp;Noble collect prize , such as government , may be
considere</div>
      <div>-d .&nbsp; </div>
      <hr size="1">
      <div> </div>
      <div>The letter&nbsp;will be sent to many American
universities&nbsp;. (sorry ,my English is not well ) , such as Harvard
, MIT , Yale ,Berkeley</div>
      <div>Columbia universities .&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now , I have three
problems&nbsp;in mathematics and physics</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is
problem&nbsp;of mathematics&nbsp;, nobody at Harvard can resolve
it&nbsp;:&nbsp; During the course of playing chess ,if every step </div>
      <div>
      <div>
      <div>of both sides is best&nbsp;after opposite side has moved a
pieces ,I will ask ,will combination of these steps be single ? If the
combination is single ,I will think it as chess of formula ,if not ,how
to change rules of chess and make it have a formula&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
" singulary " means that ,at least ,all residual pieces of every a
board game are same and their&nbsp;places are same after the lost side
has moved the last piece .&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second and
third&nbsp;are problems of physics&nbsp;, they&nbsp;are at last
part&nbsp; of my third article</div>
      <div>---Ruling Physics&nbsp;,&nbsp;Certainly ,&nbsp;Aeronautics
and Astronautics can do it .&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three articles
which I will send everyone is&nbsp;conclusions which I have </div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>reaserched&nbsp;economy ,physics and physiology .</div>
      <div>
      <div>&nbsp; I have a deep feeling which there are many problems
in our&nbsp;economic society and it should be improved ,although some
aspects improve&nbsp;greatly and express that our reality is far from
our ideal ,even if their distance is far ,we must know our
shortcoming&nbsp;, such as what I write in my article about economy :</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) problem&nbsp;which prices are
unreasonable ; 2) problem&nbsp;which&nbsp;measure units are simplified
;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Coefficent of strength can meature quantity of labours
when people use a machine&nbsp;, on a machine&nbsp;the
coefficent&nbsp;can be told&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) problem of
web&nbsp; 5) problem&nbsp;of overpopulation&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the present , it is most
appropriately that model of European Federate works as humanity economy
in comparation to other countries in the world&nbsp;, and some
economical policy is similiar to humanity economy , such as&nbsp;
policy of subsidy of agriclture&nbsp;, combination
of&nbsp;enterprises&nbsp;.... , they may be a winner of Noble .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly ,American
government&nbsp;, since Franclin Roltsv government after war of the
world until Bush government ,&nbsp;pay attention to&nbsp;problem of
prices&nbsp;and payment ,&nbsp;the article will be of benefit&nbsp;to
them .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;a&nbsp; price should be unified .
      <div>&nbsp;b&nbsp; &nbsp;A super computer&nbsp;can compute
payment of everyone as their working standard , such as coeffient of
srength , working time , price of quantity of unit labour and capacity
price , then it pays for their payment to their terminals which can put
into a magnetical card by wireless web directly .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;c&nbsp; By web ,I hope that new president can
popularize new measure units of humanity economy ,&nbsp;begining
with&nbsp;electrical currency .
      <div>if it is done well ,he can be a Noble winner .&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp; It is easy to produce electrical currency , valuable
magnetical card which we are using
      <div>-g can be&nbsp;become into electrical currency if law admits
them , such as&nbsp;magnetical card </div>
      <div>which students of universities buy food&nbsp;; magnetical
card which is used in moblie telepho</div>
      <div>-ne ; Electrical ticket on plane or in the field of NBA .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The article will be of
benefit&nbsp;to them .</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem of overpopulation is a big
problem that Asia ,Africa and Latin America face ,many countries think
,including&nbsp;JinTau&nbsp; Hu government of China ,and Speaker of
last government
      <div>&nbsp;Peng Lee&nbsp;,&nbsp; ,population policy is a
big&nbsp;problem&nbsp;and we need&nbsp;pay attention
to&nbsp;popularizing policy of Planned birth to the world ,
I&nbsp;appeal, all countries should carry out it severiously .</div>
      </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overpopulation
often brings problem of immigrant&nbsp; troubles</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as physics
is concerned , many basic&nbsp;particles have all kinds of&nbsp;rule
,but whether these&nbsp;laws may come from combination of
basic&nbsp;laws which substance must have ,whether basic particles
which physics is reaserching micro&nbsp;pieces of substance with
basic&nbsp;laws ,which is often seen by us ?&nbsp;Is &nbsp;Field theory
far from test so that it becomes to&nbsp;divate reality ? Can
ways&nbsp;which we reaserch basic rule of subtance reaserch better
physics ?&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;will talk about&nbsp;my opoinon in
"&nbsp;ruling physics ' ,another ,I recommend
a&nbsp;ideal&nbsp;experiment ,please read "ruling physics "&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am interested
in reaserching human brain since the age of&nbsp;Senior school ,I
reaserched thinking of brain by means of feeling myself , and I did
several experiments of physiology </div>
      <div>in thinking ,such as :&nbsp;discomposition of pictures and
combination&nbsp; ;&nbsp;&nbsp;discomposing sentence and making
sentence ;&nbsp; continuous thinking ,and generalized a set of
experience which it is dufficult for physiologists to be understood
,&nbsp;here , I contribute these conclusions to our artificial
intelligence and I designs a artificial
intelligence&nbsp;machine&nbsp;,it can help many corporations&nbsp;and
universities develop their computers .&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Substance&nbsp;has no
any colours , colours come from colour cells of eyes as different
wavelengths of light&nbsp;is attracted by these cells to engender
colours .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another ,as technology of modern web is developped rapitly ,people
communicate by web in a lager degree ,I&nbsp;am going to contribute
them to people by web so thst it is generalized to publication&nbsp;and
make publication&nbsp;disseminate more thought .</div>

Humanity Economy</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <div>
      <div>
      <div>Humanity Economy which I recommend a new economy which human
is thought&nbsp;of source , it stresses the princeple which all kinds
of basic necessities of life can meet requirement of everyone on the
base of average and&nbsp;payment of everyone is as same as labour which
he&nbsp;offer .</div>
      <div>To reach the princeple , it&nbsp;builds a set of theory and
way which scocity unite production and assignment&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)&nbsp;Equality of all prices .
physical characters of All goods are equivalent&nbsp;,so we may make
their prices same ,and we may simplify our currency and&nbsp;make ratio
of all kinds of currents .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantum current may be instead of present
current ,it&nbsp;based on one unit&nbsp;current as monetary </div>
      <div>unit .</div>
      <div>&nbsp; Another , quantum price may be instead of present
price , one quantum price equals one monetary unit .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Unity of&nbsp;measure ,presntly
,our&nbsp;measure is&nbsp;confused , some goods based on unit of mass
kg , some based on unit of length&nbsp;m ,or on piece&nbsp;,&nbsp;for
we&nbsp;compute convenienly&nbsp;,so we need simplify it&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another , if
unity of&nbsp;measure is carried&nbsp;out , we may adjust rate&nbsp;to
time&nbsp;of&nbsp;unit </div>
      <div>working , payment / time of unit
working&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit of&nbsp;a commodity and price of unit
of&nbsp;commodity to the&nbsp;simplest&nbsp;formality :&nbsp;&nbsp;
1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 :&nbsp;1 : 1 .</div>
      <div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Payment of labourers</div>
      <div>Computation of labour price ,When production of society is
low ,quantity of labour which&nbsp;many pays for&nbsp;are big ,so price
of labour of everyone must be computated&nbsp;.So , we recommend
coefficient of&nbsp;strength ,it means that under the certain condition
, quantity of labour which production of unit goods consumes ,so&nbsp;:</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Labour price =&nbsp;price of
quantity of unit labour&nbsp;* coefficient of&nbsp;strength * number of
produced goods&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payment of a labourer = labour
price + capacity price </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capacity price means that price
which production of a kind of goods need capacity , it can
be&nbsp;ruled as degrees of quality which&nbsp;standard of&nbsp;trade
classify for goods or service</div>
      <div>which&nbsp;labourers produce or provide with , every degree
of quality corresponds one&nbsp; capacity price&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are developed
most , payment of labourers can be omitted .At the time ,coefficent of
strength is lowest</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4)Anyone have right which enjoys
warefare .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5)Industry and commerce of all
society combine together .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All society is controlled by
a center-control system which is made up of computers , productions of
enterprise are controlled by it as commerce ,producing or not
,circulation of product between enterprises is&nbsp;periodical</div>
      <div>
      <div>After&nbsp;a picture enters brain by eyes first connect with
thinking point&nbsp;which store its name ,next ,when another picture
enters brain , it connects with thinking points&nbsp;which store its
thinking point ,&nbsp;names of the two pictures are&nbsp;compared
,&nbsp;if they are same ,the second picture will be thought as the
first ; If they are different ,they will become into a bigger picture .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6)
Electrical current
      <div>A super computer&nbsp; can compute payment of everyone as
their working standard , such as coeffient of srength , working time ,
price of quantity of unit labour and capacity price , then it pays for
their payment to their terminals which can put into a magnetical card
by wireless web directly .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Theory&nbsp; of&nbsp; Thinking</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After words and phrases
enter&nbsp;auditory&nbsp;nerve cells ,the&nbsp;manny words and
phrases&nbsp;Pailie in a thinking lines ,some thinking lines don't
accord with logic of our language , so they are discarded ,some lines
accord logic and are remembered brain as voice&nbsp;order .</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity Economy
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      <div>Humanity Economy which I recommend a new economy which human
is thought&nbsp;of source , it stresses the princeple which all kinds
of basic necessities of life can meet requirement of everyone on the
base of average and&nbsp;payment of everyone is as same as labour which
he&nbsp;offer .</div>
      <div>To reach the princeple , it&nbsp;builds a set of theory and
way which scocity unite production and assignment&nbsp;.</div>
      </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;Price of commodity
will be dismissed ,price of commodity will change into quantum price of
commodity ; Current also changes into&nbsp;quantum current ,
payment&nbsp;which&nbsp;quantity of labour corresponds to is not same
as quantum price of commodity ,but both need be realitied by quantum
current .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humanity think
,commodities are articles which are bought to&nbsp;persons and can't be
used in production which is based on no
benefit&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;material&nbsp;which&nbsp;produces&nbsp;any
commodity is come from resource including the earth ,these material can
be well used , but they&nbsp;don't have value&nbsp;naturally ,
but&nbsp;they are given value when people use or sell or buy
commdities&nbsp;; If we&nbsp;are attributed&nbsp;value which quantity
of labour which&nbsp;production of the commdity consumes corresponds to
and is&nbsp;engendered during the course of production of the commodity
which is produced by these material , to producers and </div>
      <div>`is paid for to producers by&nbsp;payment which a
producer&nbsp;gets and is signed by current , then a commdity&nbsp;is
unnecessarily given any value , i.e. ,a commodity doesn't include any
value&nbsp;. Value of labour is unnecessarily&nbsp;included in
commdities&nbsp;, but every&nbsp;article can be thought as
&nbsp;commodity to be sold ,however ,it is product or half-product ,or
material , we need recommend concept of quantum price&nbsp;and quantum
current&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quantum price&nbsp;means that
the regulation&nbsp;price&nbsp;of sale when&nbsp;a article is regarded
as a commodity and is sold ,becuase so far as any commodity is
concerned ,it doesn't&nbsp;have the meaning&nbsp;of virtue and
shortcoming and whether it is man-made or produced naturally according
to&nbsp;objective standard if people discard virtue and shortcoming as
subjective standard&nbsp; , our every commodity need&nbsp;&nbsp;be
given a regulation price&nbsp;without any meaning except&nbsp;it stand
for a certain quantity ,this is quantum price&nbsp;.Quantum price is
always certain and&nbsp;quantum prices of unit commodities are same
,and don't float ,and is unitedly controlled by&nbsp;nation ; Quantum
current is shaped by dividing current into some same shares whose may
buy a commodity ,when it is used as payment and welfare of producers
to&nbsp;send to people ,it can be used as a kind of&nbsp;measure unit
of current which&nbsp;counts how many commoditities are
bought&nbsp;,after it&nbsp;is regarded as current to be consumed
,it&nbsp;will lose effect .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After we have the two concepts
,&nbsp;we may get model of economy under the conditon of humanity
economy&nbsp;:&nbsp;when a labourer produces a commodity or offers a
service , he get&nbsp;corresponding payment , then he sells his
commodity in quantum price , people buy these commodities
of&nbsp;equavalent price&nbsp;by payment&nbsp;or welfare which
countries&nbsp;pay for producers&nbsp;or the ordinaty in the form of
quantum current .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quantity of quantum current&nbsp;in
circulation&nbsp;is not controlled by general quantity of commodities
in society completely&nbsp;, general quantity of social commodities and
quantum current in circulation are unnecessarily same ,but it is
required that prices are controlled by&nbsp;nation and general quantity
of quantum current in circulation is&nbsp;small or equavalent in
comparation to general quantum prices of commodities in circulation
,because the whole commodities in circulation is&nbsp;smaller
than&nbsp;people general power of buy&nbsp;, it is just&nbsp;all
right&nbsp;that&nbsp;these commodities can be&nbsp;assigned to all
people;When people 'general power of buy is smaller than general
quantity of commodities in circulation , it is certain that people buy
commodities which they need&nbsp;. In brief , quantum current in
circulation&nbsp;always equals the lowest of general quantity of
commodities in circulation&nbsp;and general power of buy , this is best
model of social commodities and quantum current in circuation in
humanity economy .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      <div>Computation of labour price ,When production of society is
low ,quantity of labour which&nbsp;many pays for&nbsp;are big ,so price
of labour of everyone must be computated&nbsp;.So , we recommend
coefficient of&nbsp;srength ,it means that under the certain condition
, quantity of labour which production of unit goods consumes ,so&nbsp;:</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Labour price =&nbsp;price of
quantity of unit labour&nbsp;* coefficient of&nbsp;strength * number of
produced goods&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payment of a labourer = labour
price + capacity price </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capacity price means that price
which production of a kind of goods need capacity , it can
be&nbsp;ruled as degrees of quality which&nbsp;standard of&nbsp;trade
classify for goods or service</div>
      <div>which&nbsp;labourers produce or provide with , every degree
of quality corresponds one&nbsp; capacity price&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are developed
most , payment of labourers can be omitted&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;At the
time ,coefficent of strength is lowest</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If unity of&nbsp;price is
carried out , many people will buy cars or planes which can live a life
on&nbsp;it ,but don't buy apartment , because price is aquavalent and
it can't move .&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 ) Unify of&nbsp;measure unit
. </div>
      <div>&nbsp;Zhiding of quantum prices need a certain princeple and
JIliang unit is&nbsp;confused ,so if a commodity&nbsp;measure
convienly&nbsp;as mass ,length ,area&nbsp;or volum ,we may set price of
commodities&nbsp;of unit mass ,unit length ,unit area or unit volum as
one quantum current unit&nbsp;,such as price of 1kg rice ,1kg beef ,
1kg iron ,1m electrical line ,1 square rag ,1&nbsp;cubic
meter&nbsp;box&nbsp;all cost one quantum current unit&nbsp;; Certainly
,if we measure them as the above unfitly , we may set price of one
commodity as one quantum current ,such as price of one car as one
quantum unit ,price of a tour or price of one hour tour as one quantum
current unit .Certainly ,some units may be used as&nbsp;habit&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we need
count&nbsp;convienly,&nbsp; it is more important&nbsp;to adjust
rate&nbsp;to&nbsp;unit&nbsp;of&nbsp;working time , payment /&nbsp;unit
of working&nbsp;time&nbsp;,&nbsp;unit of&nbsp;a commodity and price of
unit of&nbsp;commodity to the&nbsp;simplest&nbsp;formality
:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 :&nbsp;1 : 1 .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;measure unit need be
reasonable ,&nbsp;we rule that one kg beef equals quanlity of beef
which produce one&nbsp;&nbsp;calorioe&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;3) Anyone has right which equavalently enjoy welfare .
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard
of&nbsp;assignment of society is based on simplity&nbsp;,according to
humanity economy ,ways of social assignment of&nbsp;wealth are more
,under the usual condition ,ways&nbsp;which we take part in social
labour and get payment&nbsp;are a usual ways&nbsp;: everyone must
complete&nbsp;social labour ,but because there is difference&nbsp;of
capacity of labour&nbsp;among people ,quantity of labour which some are
paid for is more ,capacity of labour is strong ,one may complete
several people 's labour ,but some mustn't&nbsp;labour&nbsp;. so , the
less&nbsp;shares of people who join social labour and whose capacity is
high may get high lever tools of production easily .&nbsp;some people
whose capacity is low mustn't take part in labour&nbsp;but
they&nbsp;join social assignment and get welfare ,but welfare of both
are equavalent&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;) The best
term&nbsp;when people work is between 30-40 , during the term ,capacity
develop best , social experience and knowledge is
more&nbsp;.In&nbsp;brief , the term is best term when capacity and
experience combine best ,before the term ,people's capacity
is&nbsp;good ,but experience is not enough , after the term ,people's
experience is not enough , capacity lowers ,so ,best&nbsp;term when
people work is between 30-40&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Industry&nbsp;,
commerce&nbsp;and bank of all society combine together .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humanity Economy
thought ,&nbsp;Center-control system (CCS)&nbsp;assignes production as
suiation&nbsp;which customers buy products ,if task of production is
completed , it may arrange the enterprise stop production until the
enterprise is assigned task again , commodities circulate between
enterprises under control of computer system of the center-control
system ,but no&nbsp;currency and other checks are exchanged ,
circulation&nbsp;of product&nbsp;among enterprises is periodic for
innovation or new enterprise .every enterprise innovates instrument
periodically as time of different length according to characters
of&nbsp;trade so&nbsp;as to make new products and make old machines be
discarded .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Consumption&nbsp;in production comes from resource and people's labour
,because a machine&nbsp;is made&nbsp;by resource&nbsp;,before resource
becomes commodities ,they&nbsp;have no&nbsp;quantum price ,and if a
machine is not used as a commodity ,it has no quantum price&nbsp;as
resource ,consumed marerial&nbsp;which is used to produce and&nbsp;wear
of the machine&nbsp;in the course of production of the
machine&nbsp;needn't be paid for ,but&nbsp;quantity of&nbsp;labour
which people consume in the course of making the machine and&nbsp;of
the machine's operation&nbsp;need be paid for in form of electrical
current . No value of machine's&nbsp;wear and material which it uses is
included in price of commodities which sell to customers .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two
ways to buy commodities :</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;
&nbsp;At place where everyone lives or works builds a
commerce&nbsp;terminal which is made up of computers , the
commerce&nbsp;terminal builds a&nbsp;private code&nbsp;for everyone at
the place , including all messages , then everyone's meesages are
stored in&nbsp;CCS , which can&nbsp;inquire about&nbsp;enterprises in
the all world and all customers' messages by web&nbsp;.When customers
buy commodities ,they only need input their codes and messages of
which&nbsp;enterprises&nbsp;are necessary , including names of
commodities ,specifications , quantities ,dilivering goods&nbsp;date
and addresses of customers , to&nbsp;computers in commerce terminals
,and send their messages to computer system in&nbsp;CCS ,computer
systems first&nbsp;inquire about&nbsp;number of money on&nbsp;accounts
according to private code , then computer systems&nbsp;ask to digital
base of enterprises&nbsp;which produce commodities which they buy
whether the commodities are being produced&nbsp;,if being produced and
price is fit ,it will send&nbsp;buying goods&nbsp;messages of customers
to enterprises by web ,enterprises privide free customers
with&nbsp;dilivering goods&nbsp;service ,then enterprises replay
message which goods have been sent to center-control system ( CCS
),CCS&nbsp;deducts fee which customers buy commodities from
their&nbsp;accounts ,fee is marked by electrical current&nbsp;.&nbsp;If
customers&nbsp;can't recieve&nbsp;the commodities ,they
may&nbsp;inquire about&nbsp;reason to CCS ; If being not produced
,computer system of CCS counts number of people who have registered
to&nbsp;buy the commodities ,if the number reaches or&nbsp;exceeds the
lowest number which CCS&nbsp;finds and of which enterprises produce the
commodities once ,CCS tell enterprises the number which people buy the
commodities&nbsp;,enterprises produce the commodities of the
corresponding number ,and sell these commdities to cumstomers as the
above ways .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the model is
easily unified to manage ,it is not also easy to pile up commodities
in&nbsp;market&nbsp;and it is not easy&nbsp;that provision of
commodities can't meet requirement .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b&nbsp;&nbsp;Enterprises
produce some commodities as&nbsp;estimate number of commodities which
customers buy and sell them to&nbsp;market ,CCS pay for producers
payment as prices of labour by web and&nbsp;accounts ,If customers want
to buy&nbsp;commodities in time ,they may go to&nbsp;markets to buy
commodities and money is sent from their&nbsp;accounts to&nbsp;market
's&nbsp;accounts&nbsp;in form of electrical current ,these commodities
in&nbsp;markets are&nbsp;only surpluses of enterprises which produce
these commodities , these commodities meet requirement which can't buy
the necessary commodities which they need .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Payment of everyone is sent to private code&nbsp;by CCS by web .</div>
      <div>A super computer in CCS can compute payment of everyone as
their working standard , such as coeffient of srength , working time ,
price of quantity of unit labour and capacity price , then it pays for
their payment to their terminals which can put into a magnetical card
by wireless web directly .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there are not
managers in enterprises ,instead ,staffes or groups who or which carry
out commands from computer system of&nbsp;CCS by web .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) Huminity
economy thinks , although economic activities which have a
closed&nbsp;relationship to&nbsp;life of&nbsp;people&nbsp;are
controlled by CCS ,there still is a organ which is elected
by&nbsp;people &nbsp;,besides the organ make some laws which is
effective in all society ,it is responsible for&nbsp;verified all kinds
of economical policies which social development need&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will
the&nbsp;organ be produced ? First , a industry-managing group( IMG
)&nbsp;is elected&nbsp;by staffes in industries ,then ,all&nbsp;citizen
in society elect all staffes in that organ&nbsp;,who include staffes of
every&nbsp;trade from one to&nbsp;several at least , from all staffes
of IMG in all industies .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will the
organ manage society ? every industries&nbsp;,trade , parties or
groups&nbsp;make a or several policies which development of a industies
,trade or society&nbsp;need , then they submit these policies
to&nbsp;the organ&nbsp;,then sevral policies are&nbsp;decided by the
organ and they are pubilished in all society ,so&nbsp;one best policy
will be elected by all citizens ,the policy will be used as
policy&nbsp;of social development at least in regulation
term&nbsp;,during the term ,all citizens elect appropriate persons to
carry out
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7) To
humanity economy ,&nbsp;it is difficult that it is carried out , but we
may try to carry out it&nbsp;,how to carry out it ? I will talk about
it :</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A)Present current is discarded at universities ,we may use electrical
current as quantum current ,its quantity is same as that of the present
current ,every universities&nbsp;set up center of electrical current
manage (CECM ) ,then we build terminal of electrical current
web&nbsp;in CECM ,th web will cover all universities ,all kinds
of&nbsp;accounts ,including&nbsp;property ,payment and commerce ,at
universities will&nbsp;close an account&nbsp; by CECM ,detailly ,the
center is responsible for&nbsp;pay for&nbsp;quantum payment of staffes
,consumption of staffes and students at all department ,
canteen&nbsp;and market.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
staffes and students at universities are&nbsp;given Payment Card ,they
may use PC to get payments which&nbsp;are&nbsp;given by CECM by
terminal of payment ,PC bring secrect code which is used to distinguish
its&nbsp;owner so that it&nbsp;isn't lost , and there are coefficent of
strength and capacity price .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B)
Payment of&nbsp;Pro. include two parts : part one is basic payment ;
Another part is capacity payment .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)
Basic payment may be count as&nbsp; such : We&nbsp;formulate coefficent
of strength&nbsp;which &nbsp;every&nbsp;Pro. teaches class ,then we
count labour which a teach consumes&nbsp;in a semester ,i.e.
,coefficent&nbsp;* number of&nbsp;classes in a semester , then
,&nbsp;counting basic payment i.e. ,quantity of labour * number of
quantum current / quantity of unit labour .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b
) Capacity payment may be&nbsp;computed as such :&nbsp;Difficulties of
every course and quanlity which&nbsp;Pro.&nbsp;give a lesson&nbsp;are
divided as rank ,every rank correspond a standard of paymennt
,CECM&nbsp;pay for&nbsp;capacity payment as payment of every rank .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment
of&nbsp;Pro.&nbsp;equals sum of two parts .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
C) When prices of commodities are unified ,prices may be divided into 3
ranks as high-rank ,mid-rank and low-rank commodities ,price of every
rank is&nbsp;comp[uted as average of all prices of commodities in the
rank .&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>

Model of Thinking and&nbsp;Theory of Artificial Intelligence Machine</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>The course of brain's thinking is a&nbsp;complicated couse
,it has a closed connection to many organs , such as eyes ,ears
,mouthes ,movement ,digest and sex ,when people are thinking ,they </div>
      <div>will be needed .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>This article of artificial intelligence will&nbsp;affect
reaserchers of artificial intelligence .</div>
      <div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our thinking need many
elements : 1 ) Nerve cell in&nbsp;cerebral cortex&nbsp;in brain ; 2 )
Nerve&nbsp;transmit cell ; 3 ) All kinds of&nbsp;hormine of
which&nbsp;coordinates nerve cells of brain&nbsp;and emotion
ordinarily&nbsp;; 4 ) Eyes and ears and so organs which
feel&nbsp;external things . Just&nbsp;these cells and organs well
co-operate&nbsp;so that we have good thinking ,&nbsp;we have understood
many things in the&nbsp;aspects . But , it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;very
difficult&nbsp;to reality artificial intelligence&nbsp;if we only
understand these , we must understand some characters and models which
concern with thinking .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nerve cells in brain
are&nbsp;arranged as&nbsp;shape of trees and are divided into
several&nbsp;layers , one&nbsp;cell connect with many cells ,this is
best structure .Analysis and synthesis often are carried
out&nbsp;between two&nbsp;layers .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>In the aspect , I will explain&nbsp;emphasis .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First , I will
introduce&nbsp;several nouns which are made by me and&nbsp;used in the
articles&nbsp;:</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)&nbsp;Thinking&nbsp;points&nbsp;:
Minimal groups of nerve cell which store one&nbsp;words and phrases or
one point in a picture&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 ) Thinking&nbsp;line : It
is&nbsp;connected by&nbsp;thinking&nbsp;point one by one , sometimes ,
it can stand for a meaning .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 ) Thinking&nbsp;web : It is
connected arbitarily by&nbsp;thinking&nbsp;lines&nbsp;,&nbsp;it stands
for either several meanings or&nbsp;one or several pictures .&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Message&nbsp;: Content
which are included in thinking&nbsp;point or thinking lines or
thinking&nbsp;points .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 ) Distinguishing message :
Messages which explain&nbsp;one&nbsp;message .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) Sign character : Groups of nerve
cells which correspondingly connect with a message or a distinguishing
message , is often between message and its distinguishing
message&nbsp;and used to thinking , when it and a message or a
distinguishing message take part in thinking ,thinking characters of
them are which feeling is deep or make impules pass by easily ,then
which&nbsp;takes part in thinking&nbsp;, and sign characters which
stand for same messages&nbsp;make impules pass by easily ,so two same
sign characters or two same messages connect easily&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Messages often&nbsp;belongs
to&nbsp;upper layer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following&nbsp;, I&nbsp;will
discribe thinking ways which artificial intelligence needs as working
theory of brain .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When one person is baby , whole
capacity of brain is in a best state ,but no&nbsp;contents in its brain
,&nbsp;cells of brain are in a thinking state without
message&nbsp;.&nbsp;As age increases ,pictures&nbsp;of external things
,vioce , taste or stiff degree enter graduately tissues
under&nbsp;cerebral cortex&nbsp;in one's&nbsp;brain by eyes , ears ,
nose or skin and so on and are simply remembered ;&nbsp;as age of one
person go on increasing , parents&nbsp;or teachers of children or
others tell children by gesture , other pictures or languages with some
meanings that express what&nbsp;the meanings of pictures , vioce ,tast
and stiff degree which they are looking at&nbsp;,listening to , tasting
and feeling are&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to finish the course ? The
following , I will explain it by ditinguishing a picture&nbsp;, when a
picture enters eyes of a baby ,his feeling cells at the bottom of eyes
produce corresponding physiological changes&nbsp;according to light and
darkness ,coulors and shapes , then these cells at the bottom of eyes
deliver these changes by their&nbsp;cells and nerve&nbsp;transmit cells
to visual&nbsp;nerve center&nbsp;,here , there are a large
number&nbsp;of&nbsp;visual&nbsp;nerve cells ,among them
,some&nbsp;visual nerves cells store whole messages which cells at the
&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;of eyes&nbsp;deliver , so one remembers the picture
,of course , message at the time ,which is as same as messages&nbsp;in
cells at the bottom of eyes ,is created&nbsp; by the corrsponding
physiological changes in optic nerve cells , because no any message
which&nbsp;explains the picture in baby's&nbsp;brain ,nerve cells which
store these messages difficultly connect with other cells&nbsp;by nerve
impules which&nbsp;cells which store these messages&nbsp; produce to
reach other parts in brain&nbsp;,i.e. , no matter how
optic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;nerve cells deal with
the picture , brain can't distinguish the picture ,so ,a
baby&nbsp;remember the picture&nbsp;for a long term , but he or she
might forget the picture and then look at another picture or listen to
another vioce .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>If someone explains to children ,the children will
understand it what that person has told him or her ,what is the
physiological course of the step ? If the&nbsp;adault&nbsp;is pointing
to the picture while he told him what it is&nbsp;and eyes or ears of
children see or hear gestures&nbsp;or&nbsp;voices&nbsp;of&nbsp;the
adault&nbsp;when they explain the picture&nbsp;at the same time that
children remember the picture&nbsp;,these voices or gestures will be
remembered by the different function 's parts&nbsp;or the same function
part ,nerve cells&nbsp;which have stored the picture and the two piece
of message in brain will connect fast ,nerve impules can transmit each
other ,so , children know a picture ,and&nbsp;the adult 's explanatory
gestures or voices can understand each other&nbsp;.Maybe ,two messages
connect each other through sign characters .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes , after children remember the picture
,but nobody tells him&nbsp;what the picture is ,he understands the
picture ,what is course ?&nbsp;Possibly ,message which children see and
hear and concerns with the picture&nbsp;possibly connect with another
message(A) in brain by the same course as ways which the last paragraph
tells .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp; One's thinking at the time&nbsp;is called as
primary thinking ,&nbsp;primary thinking mainly includes :
remembrance&nbsp;, primary distinction and judgement to things&nbsp;and
make message which one thing shapes in brain connect with
distinguishing message , because&nbsp;message of one person is less ,
so one has capacity of senior thinking , but senior thinking is
difficult ,when one thinks primarily ,message which&nbsp;one person
stores is often distinguished easily with external help&nbsp;: If
things which will be distinguished and explanatory things or
pictures&nbsp;are&nbsp;taken together or explanatory languages and
the&nbsp;message are said out&nbsp;by others at the same time , so ,it
is easy to make the message and its explanatory message be taken in
same part of listeners and make them connect so that people distinguish
a thing from others ,however ,primary thinking can distinguish a thing
from others ,but so far as senior thinking is conerned ,it is often
used to distinguish one thing from others&nbsp;at the age of&nbsp;the
adault&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As message&nbsp;in brain increases
,distinction&nbsp; of message don't need help of external ,it is brain
that actively distinguishes ,and chance of distinction increases fast
to make people capacity of distinction strenghten .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time ,that people know things not
only requires distinction of whole picture ,but also distinguish
characters of parts of picture ,so ,thinking of one person will enter
senior thinking ,.During the&nbsp;period ,brain of people
need&nbsp;analyse ,remember again ,judge again ,then&nbsp;synthesis
,this need deal with conclusion of analysis logically and replenish
imagination and distinguish again and judge again .If we think over a
problem ,we will need these steps .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following ,I will talk about ways of
senior thinking ,this is key which we reaserch artificial intelligence .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because senior thinking
is&nbsp;completed under&nbsp;the condition that message which brain
remembers is very more ,one person distinguishes things easily ,But ,at
the time&nbsp;it need to be divided into&nbsp;two suiation :</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Distinction of&nbsp;new things
or pictures ; B ) distinction of old things or pictures .</div>
      <div>the two suiations are divided into distinction of the whole
body or distionction of parts ,first I talk about A):&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Distinction of a whole thing or a
picture&nbsp;, the step is same as primary thinking ,but often ,some
thinking points&nbsp;which stand for characters of the picture connect
to&nbsp;one or several distinguishing message&nbsp;by sign characters .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Distinction of parts of&nbsp;a thing
or a picture ,some thinking points which stand for characters of the
picture connect to one or several distinguishing message by sign
characters.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I talk about B ) :</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mater whether&nbsp;the whole
body&nbsp;or&nbsp;part pictures ,when it enters brain first ,the
corresponding nerve cells in brain leave trails of remembrance ,the
part of nerve cells are active in comparison with&nbsp;unused cells
,another ,similarities of&nbsp;the two messages are more ,groups of
cells&nbsp;which store two messages&nbsp;easily connect ,this is
because the two pictures easily&nbsp;overlapping , the nerve impulses
which cells produce easily trainsmit between the two thinking points by
the common points ,so message which&nbsp;enter brain later will be
distinguished by the distinguishing message or sign&nbsp;characters of
the first message .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as people 's age&nbsp;increases
,they have begun to analyse things ,brains have had strong capacity
whcih&nbsp;treat with&nbsp;pictures and things , the capacity is called
as analysis and synthesis .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysis to a picture&nbsp;which we say
is dealt with in brain : when&nbsp;a picture&nbsp;need be analysed
,&nbsp;sign&nbsp;characters of some parts of it connect with some
sign&nbsp;characters of message which break down the picture in these
parts ,so ,the parts which are broken down&nbsp;are
distinguished&nbsp;or are used&nbsp;in other aspects
,as&nbsp;attraction is .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After analysis , brains need synthesis to
these parts&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Synthesis is divided into non-logical
sythesis and logical synthesis&nbsp;:</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-logical synthesis ,
sign&nbsp;chracters of several&nbsp;parts which&nbsp;are broken down
and other messages&nbsp;combine arbitrily&nbsp;and&nbsp;some messages
among them also&nbsp;combine arbitrily as&nbsp;combination of
sign&nbsp;characters ,then conclusions&nbsp;are ditinguished .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logical synthesis , sign&nbsp;characters
of several parts which are broken down and other messages&nbsp;combine
as a rule which sign characterss shape .At the time , sign characters
need look for&nbsp;similarities with a rule&nbsp;, first ,then sign
characters connect each other as the rule .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people's imagination and computation
and so on course of intelligence include analysis and synthsis&nbsp;,if
one's&nbsp;number of cells which take part in thinking is more ,one's
quantity of&nbsp;hormone is more and one's&nbsp;branch of
cells&nbsp;are more&nbsp;,he is highly intelligent&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shutu Mathematicians'brain &nbsp;are more
so ,their sign characters which connect with same messages
are&nbsp;more ,their&nbsp;lever of resolve ,&nbsp;physisits'
cells&nbsp;which are used at same time in&nbsp;brain are more ,so their
imaginations&nbsp;are plenty .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our all thinking are included in these
steps ,&nbsp;So far as language is concerned , its thinking course
&nbsp;is same as pictures , approximately ,but there are some different
points : </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) pictures are often distinguished by
voices&nbsp;; languages are often distinguished by pictures .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Distinguishing pictures need&nbsp;less
rules ; sometimes ,distinguishing languages need distinguishing message
with&nbsp;certain rules ,and its message is easily transmitted to
language</div>
      <div>center&nbsp;in brain .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Pictures combine arbitrily ;
Combination of languages need&nbsp;certain rules .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking&nbsp;about languages&nbsp;begin with
voice&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>When voice&nbsp;first&nbsp;enter ears and they are stored
in&nbsp;auditory nerve cells&nbsp;of&nbsp;brain as frequency&nbsp;in
form of signals in brain ,these signals of voices look for&nbsp;other
thinking points which store some message&nbsp;or sign characters by
nerve impules to make&nbsp;these signals of vioces connect with the
thinking point which&nbsp;has a&nbsp;strong connection
with&nbsp;hormone of brain to shape a message and be understood by
brain ,this is distinction of voices&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the age of&nbsp;baby ,when
he&nbsp;listens&nbsp;to&nbsp;the adault&nbsp;,one
sentence&nbsp;enters&nbsp;auditory&nbsp;nerve center&nbsp;in
his&nbsp;brain ,&nbsp;&nbsp;some&nbsp;voices of words in the sentence
is distinguished&nbsp;as&nbsp;model of distinguishing a picture , some
distinguishing messages come from&nbsp;the adault&nbsp;'s&nbsp;gesture
,including voices and gestures&nbsp;of&nbsp;the
adault&nbsp;,becuse&nbsp;babies are little ,they often regard
distinguishing messages as meaning of&nbsp;some words in the sentence ,
as his age increases ,&nbsp;if&nbsp;the adault&nbsp;don't tell him
other meaning by other voice or gestures and he remembers the sentence
or&nbsp;the adault&nbsp;tell him meaning of sentence ,&nbsp;sometimes
,he will&nbsp;regard the meaning what&nbsp;the adault&nbsp;have told as
meaning of sentence&nbsp;.So , he undertands meaning of the sentence
and some words&nbsp;in sentence .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When babies&nbsp;give a
voice&nbsp;,he can speak a sentence&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;order
of&nbsp;message which&nbsp;are stored in&nbsp;auditory&nbsp;center and
are transmited to&nbsp;language center&nbsp;by&nbsp;transmit cells ,the
message are made up of voices in sentence&nbsp;of&nbsp;the adault&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As his age goes on incresing
,&nbsp;messages which stores words&nbsp;also increaes&nbsp;,when number
of these messages reaches a degree&nbsp;, brain of babies begin to make
sentences by these words as what&nbsp;the adault&nbsp;tell to
express&nbsp;his meaning .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our theory
of field has explained laws of our particles difficultly ,</div>
      <div>to all kinds of particles , it's difficult to
discribe&nbsp;nature of any of them&nbsp;clearly&nbsp;, so we need a
new means which make physics reaserch them easily , so I introduce a
means which reaserch basic nature of substance , then by combining
these basic natures ,we get all natures of particles .</div>
      </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A model
which basic particles exist -------model of permanent <br>
magnetism bodies . <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A permanent magnetism body's shape
is round , elliptic or other <br>
rule's or non-rule's shape . it has mass , it can produce a field of <br>
gravitation , meaning that gravitation is its basic character , <br>
gravitation can be distributed as time and space and can pike up , it
meets to <br>
spin<br>
continuously and vibrate as condition of de'broe waves , its erengry is
      <br>
E=hy and it meets Shcrodinger's Equation under the conditon of <br>
relativity or non-relativity ;<br>
; Although its spin is continuous , it can attract or set out
      <div>
      <div>a certain length of wave's erengry and make itself leap
between basic and&nbsp;stimulated states .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 's difficult for a
permanent magnetism body&nbsp;to exist alonely , it often</div>
      <div>attracts other permenet magnetism
bodies&nbsp;and&nbsp;exists&nbsp;as all&nbsp;kinds of constructions
,when two permanent magnetism bodies&nbsp;meet , they can counter--spin
parallely , when both are dipoled by a magnetic field , one magnentic
pole of one permanent magnetism body will go with another pole of
another permanent magnetsim body parallely&nbsp;so as to complement
each other ,&nbsp;when&nbsp;number&nbsp;of permmanent magnnetism bodies
is&nbsp;more , they can form a big eddy with spin .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One big permenet
magnentism body includes many&nbsp;small permanent magnetism bodies in
same character ,when these&nbsp;small permanent magnetism bodies in it
evenly ,its both ends </div>
      <div>attract each other and it produces an even forces
field&nbsp;around itself ; When it is impacted by outer forces fields
or is striked by other forces&nbsp;so that distribution
of&nbsp;those&nbsp;small permenet magnentism bodies aren't even
,&nbsp;density of&nbsp;the one end in it is&nbsp;heavy and another is
thin , so an un-even forces field&nbsp;is produced around it as both
ends attract each other&nbsp;so that it is&nbsp;dipoled ( magnetic
dipolation ) , it becomes a dipoled body ;When it attracts a
certain&nbsp;frequency erengy , it is also dipoled ,(electrical
dipolation ) .</div>

        <div>
        <div>Spin axis of a permanent magnetism body&nbsp;is on the
lines which difference of gravitations of its both poles is most ,when
a permanent magnetism body spins as direction of outer forces
fields&nbsp;,if gravitations of the both ends are same,direction of
axis of spin&nbsp;is same as that&nbsp;of outer forces fields.When
gravitations of the both ends are different,axis of spin and direction
of outer forces fields form&nbsp; an angle,the angle will make magnetic
forces moment zero. <br>
&nbsp; When one permanent magnentism body is discomposed into many
smaller permanent magnetism bodies,these small permanent magnetism
bodies are small particles which are striked or basic particles of
physics,here the model is basic model which basic particles exist,if a
permanent magnetism body is divided smaller and thinner,effect of
forces field which it produce will be more distinct.If construction of
permanent magnetism bodies accords with a certain rule at the time that
they gather,forces field of their polymer is easily offset,and
phenomenon of dipolation is less,so,substance is more
neutral,so,permanent magnetism bodies can be called as&nbsp;basic
particles in physics .
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following , I will generalize it
and its rules so that I can get regulation physics

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to
phenomennon of electric-magnetism ,we can consider a model&nbsp;which
substance</div>
      <div>exists ,I call it as permanent magnet body&nbsp;.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be shape of ball
,ellipse or other all kinds of shapes ,characteres of its both
ends&nbsp;are same&nbsp;without outer forces field ,when it is affacted
by outer forces field ,it can be</div>
      <div>dipoled ,spin ,one end launches forces&nbsp;and
another&nbsp;absorb forces .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In it ,there are many
little permanent magnetic body&nbsp;whoes characters are same as it is ,</div>
      <div>they may vibrate around the point of balance and shape a big
eddy or they gather altogaher .</div>
      <div>amount them all kinds of little permenent magnetic bodies
can be delivered so that all kinds of forces fields can be produced
amount them .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do they produce forces
fields ? When they are affacted by outer forces fields ,for they can
reach new structure model of balance from another structure model of
balance ,they set out&nbsp;parts of little permanent magnet bodies to
other little permanent magnetic bodies&nbsp;or other parts&nbsp;,too
,so that forces can be delivered
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp; Substance is made up of many unruling
microparticles with&nbsp;different nature&nbsp;,these microparticles
have</div>
      <div>many common characters ,these characters are that of
substance ,&nbsp;these microparticles form &nbsp;all kinds of basic
particles , so&nbsp;we reaserch physics as
these&nbsp;characters&nbsp;will be far better than the nowdays ways .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Characters of the microparticles
are so :</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;These microparticles have
characters of mass&nbsp;and&nbsp;movement ,groups of
microparticles&nbsp;make up a system ,the system is called as
high-energy system ,all microparticles are in a state of high-energy
,some parts of these substance are microparticles ,other parts&nbsp;are
high-density microsubstance ,they can deliver energy&nbsp;rapidly
within the short time and in short distance ,&nbsp;they can
be&nbsp;delivered at the&nbsp;velocity of light and can
produce&nbsp;wave .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) these&nbsp;microparticles can have
attracting forces and condense under low temperature
.Because&nbsp;density and energy&nbsp;are different&nbsp;in them at the
time ,it is easy to&nbsp;attract itself , so that microparticles are
easily dipoled ,&nbsp;this produces magnetism of microparticles .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3)&nbsp;Charge is a kind of states
of high-energy dipolation of photon ,photon is largely produced when
microparticles&nbsp;produce big bangs .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Under a certain condition
,microparticles can&nbsp;arrange as a certain rules
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 ) When microparticles
produce&nbsp;big bangs ,some or all microparticles can be in a state of
high-energy ,some condensed microparticles are discomposed into
many&nbsp;smaller microparticles; After big bangs ,these microparticles
can make up new bigger microparticles&nbsp;under a certain condition .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we strike
microparticles ,it is possible to be like big bangs .</div>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 ) nuclei and
electrons&nbsp;are&nbsp;microparticles , under&nbsp;the outer fields ,
nuclui can be dipoled ,and it produces magnetic field forces , these
forces can attract electrons ,because </div>
      <div>nuclei and electrons continuously vibrate ,this
makes&nbsp;magnetic force lines&nbsp;of magnetism
field&nbsp;continuously change&nbsp;at any a point ,and electron will
attract a certain number of photons with same frequency&nbsp;as that of
itself and produce electrical field ,so electric-magnetic fields can be
produced around&nbsp;nucleus , electritic-magnetic fields make spin axe
of electron around&nbsp;it have a angle with nuclei and sum magnetic
force&nbsp;moment is zero , at same time ,directions of dipoles of
electron and dipoles of nuclei are opposed&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
by those which are delivered&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
