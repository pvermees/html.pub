Most of the pictures were taken by myself, others by Jim Metcalf.
The remaining pictures were sent to me by email by Jessie Xie 
and others by email. Whenever I could trace back the 
original source of those images, I contacted the
owner for permission to post them on my site, and added a URL to the
picture. If you recognize a picture that was taken by you, please 
contact me and I'll properly acknowledge your work.<br>
