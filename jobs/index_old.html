<h3>Five year position in noble gas geochronology</h3>
We are looking to fill a 5 year Research Assistant (RA) position
funded by the European Research Council (ERC). 
The successful candidate will be in 
charge of the day-to-day operation and
maintenance of the Nu Instruments Noblesse Noble Gas mass spectrometer
at LGC and oversee the expansion
of its existing extraction line with calibration tanks and a
resistance furnace for the purpose of general noble gas
geochemistry, with specific focus on argon and helium thermochronology. 
Beyond these tasks, the RA will be given full freedom to
explore his/her own research ideas.

<h3>Three year position in U-Pb geochronology by LA-ICP-MS</h3>
We are looking to appoint a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant (36 month
position) to work on the NERC funded <i>Dust storm trajectories and
Chinese loess over the last 22 million years</i> project. A main aim of
the project is to constrain the sources of the extensive late Cenozoic
loess deposits in China, and link changes in these sources with
changing influences on dust production and transport. The project
utilises a multi-technique approach centred on established and novel
single-grain heavy mineral geochemical/geochronological analyses. The
successful candidate will primarily be involved in research into
zircon U-Pb dating and imaging the sources of late Cenozoic loess and red clay
sequences on the Chinese Loess Plateau, as well as samples from
surrounding desert systems. This is a joint project between Birkbeck
and Royal Holloway, University of London (RHUL), where a
second Post-Doctoral Researcher will focus on the heavy mineral
petrography and garnet geochemistry of the same samples. The project
will involve fieldwork and sampling programs at the key sites in
China, as well as laboratory visits to the NERC Isotope Geosciences
Laboratory at Keyworth.
