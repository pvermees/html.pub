<h3>Barchan dune collisions in the Bodele Depression (Chad)</h3>

Although the dynamics of individual barchan dunes is well understood,
their interactions are the subject of ongoing scientific interest and
debate. Numerical and analog models have predicted that (1) 'head-on'
collisions of barchans can have the appearance of solitary waves (aka
solitons); and (2) 'off-center' collisions result in mass transfer
between dunes. This website contains a number of animations serving to
illustrate the first direct real-world observations of these
phenomena, using time series of high resolution optical satellite
imagery from the Bodele Depression in northern Chad.

There are a total of twenty animations of solitary wave behavior and
off-center collisions, which can be viewed by clicking on the
hyperlinks on top of this page. Depending on your connection, the
animations can take a few minutes to load, as they ~2Mb in size
each. A full list of the satellite scenes used can be
found <a href="."><b>here</b></a>.  For further details and
discussion, see the <i>Science</i> Brevia manuscript
entitled <i>"Solitary wave behavior in barchan dunes observed from
space"</i>.
